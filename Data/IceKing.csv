  Hey, Ice King! Stop it!| Heh? Stop meddling, boy! You and your magical dog can't harm me.
  Why are you always stealing ladies?| I'm going to make one marry me! 
  That's... stupid!| Your hat is stupid!
  You are crazy. You are so crazy.|  Now I've got you, boy! 
  Let's go!| Heh?
  Yay!| Nwah. How dare they trifle with me. They can't possibly think they can win!
  Hey, sloppy milkshake!| Wha?
  Why don't you pick on someone your own size?| Fool! Your powers are no match for my magical crown!
 Other|  My powers! Foul and noisome whelp! You've not seen the last of my wintery fangs! I'll cleave the warmth from your bones and stop still your beating heart with my claaaaws...
  I'm a flying dog! | What?!  Who dares enter the Ice Kingdom?!
  Aww, Ice King's here.|" You know why I'm here? Do you know what ""Ice King"" means?!"
  Oh ho oh! Holy cow!| It means I'm King of Ice! This is my domain! And you are violating Ice World law--trespassing!
  No, I mean--|  I don't care! This is my kingdom. You guys can't just scoot about on my land willy-nilly. I've got rules here.
   Why don't you just try being cool.|  What?! I am the king! I am the king of c-cool c-co ca... That's it! Rise, monsters of snow, and go beat up Finn and Jake! 
  |  Ooh, you guys are gonna get it.
  Yeah, right, sure.|  I need a magic back.  Trail mix.  Ick...ooh, yogurt chip.  Tuck, tuck.  Aww man.
 Other| I'm back home! Hello, ladies!
 Other| Now, now. I've brought you a baby and a puppy. 
  Ice King!| What?
  Why are you keeping these girls prisoners, jerk?| You don't understand! I collect princesses because I want to marry one.
  Well, why'd you capture six of them if you just want to marry one?| I'm collecting them all first to be sure I make the right choice. You're both too young to understand, but marriage is a serious thing and lasts forever. You can't just rush into it, you know?
  Ice King, don't do this. Just let the girls go. They don't want to be here.| Of course they do! I would have killed them already if they didn't want to be here. Right ladies?  Zzhp Zzhp.
  Yay!| 
  Darn it!|Nice try, boy! Princesses, did you see? Did you see Finn fail?
  Don't worry, Finn. I'll get us out of here with Key Hand! Hah-hah! | Oh, no you won't! 
  Jake!| Eat it.
  Ice King! You better either set us free or come in here and fight me 'cause otherwise I'm gonna flip out!!!| Oh, are you trying to hit me? Well, excuse me because I have to go potty in the bathroom. 
  I'm bored, and I'm not having any fun.|"  What? Not having any fun? But last night I read you the story of ""Baby Whatsit and the Bottle Prince."""
  That wasn't fun. That was lame.| Other princesses, do you feel the same way?
 Other| Well, here, watch. I'll show you. We'll have some fun. Fun's my middle name.
 Other| Here, now, Wildberry Princess. I need you to play this. 
  I don't know how.| Well, come here, I'll teach you. Put your hand through the bars, atta princess, and uh... 
  I don't think I can.| Just play it like I showed you.
  Leave her alone, Ice King!| PLAY IT OR I'LL SQUISH YOU INTO JUICE!!!
  Oh dear! | Yeah, keep playing it. Now everyone pick up an instrument and play it. Oh, this is going to be so much fun!
 Sweet| Oh, that was fun!
  Ah! It was fun! Hey, you should get some more fun stuff.| You're right! Good idea, Finn.
"  ""Good idea,"" indeed."| I hope they think I'm fun. 
"  I'm gonna say something fun like ""Oh yeah, I'm having a fun time! Oh my gosh, havin' the best time I've ever had in my entire life!"""| Make way for the fun tray! Whoa, what's happening?
 Other| What is this?
  We're having fun! Whoopee!| Because I left the room?
  Because they like it here. Because they like you. Because you're a really fun guy!| I don't get this.
  Wanna dance with us, Ice King? Come on!| Me? You want to dance with me?
  Oh yeah! Whoo! Woohoo!|  Wow!  Yes! Yes! Whoopee!
 Other| Wait, no!  Don't leave! I'll kill you all!  Why are you doing this? Everyone was finally warming up to me.
  But you gotta get it in you're head, man! Putting princesses in jail is wrong!| Bah! Finn, you just ruined my chances with 5 or 6 potential wives! For that you will...  Ohh! Oh, my beard. 
 Other| Why do people not like me? Is it because I'm a magic user or is my beard too shaggy?  I try so hard to be a good husband for girls. What's wrong with me?
  Hoo. You're a sociopath.| Who are you?  I know. You're probably a--a big nerd! Why don't you try being cool like me?  Star dust is so ticklish!  What happened? Princesses? Ohhh...
  Hey, fart-face!!| Huh?
  Unhand Princess Bubblegum!!| Foolish interlopers! Zah! 
   Whoa!  Ah!| Ee hee hee hee—OOH!  MY EYESIGHT!
  Hey, Ice King! I bet you'll never kiss the princess!| I will kiss her! I will!  Hold still.  Mwah!
   You just kissed Jake's butt!| What?!  EEEEGH!!   The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, Princess—MINE!
   She hates me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio.| No, Finn!  You were not wrong. He is evil! 
  I don't care! I only care about Ricardio!| But my enervated condition has everything to do with him.  I was trying to cast a spell that would give me total control of Princess Bubblegum's heart! ...But I messed it all up... and lost control of mine.  He planned to rip out Princess Bubblegum's heart... to make it his bride.  Without my heart, I grew weak.  But I made my way to the Candy Kingdom to look for him. In an alleyway, I begged him to  return to me and leave the princess alone.  But he threw me in the dumpster and left me for dead.  Stop Ricardio!
  And my fist?!|  Stop! Stop it! That's my heart, you piece of—
  I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man.| Oh, yeah...
  Wait! Wait! No!| Come to daddy...
  Noooooooooo!| Yeah, there you go...  Like that? Huh?
   Seeee you guys laterrrr...|  I feel wonderful! Hahaha! And now that I've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day!
  Yeah, no, I won't!| Yes you WILL!  Well... maybe not today... or tomorrow... but another day! Another—
  Hmm... I can't quite make it out. | Eee!
  The Ice King?!| Think this is the right address,  mmm is this, is this....
  Aww.| You can not defeat me, child!
  Whoo, hoo hoo!|  Now I can kill you! Oh wait, wait, wait. I am so stupid! Silly Billy! I came by to tell you the good news!
  What's the good news?| I'm getting married... to someone who wants to marry me! 
 Other| My betrothed is right over there!  Hi, honey!
  Hey, cool guy.| I'm a lucky guy—I didn't even have to kidnap this one! She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring! 
   Bye-bye!|" The lady penguins are throwing her one of those ""bachelorette"" parties."
  Hmm... if you get married, what about capturing princesses?| Oh well, no more capturing pretty princesses for this Ice King! 
  Ohhh...  well, fare thee well, Ice King!| Hmm?
  We totally support your decision to stop capturing princesses!  I'm happy for him. |"  Sure wish someone would throw me a bachelorette party—oop, I mean, ""man-lorette"" party."
  But we hate you.| If you won't throw me man-lorette party, then I'll never have my last hurrah before buckling down with that battle axe! It'll drive me back to a life of stealing hot princesses! Is that what you want?!
   Shhh, I know. I know that you can't have that. Don't worry.  Alright, let's go party, Ice King.| 
  | 
  | Fah!  Hahahaha! Now I'm gonna go get married! Hehehehe! ♫I'm gonna get married!♪
  No more stealing princesses!| Yeah--wait. No more s-stealing princesses? Wow.
   What?!| I didn't realize I'd have to give up stealing the ladies.
  But you said you were fine with it!| I know what I said, but, y'know, sometimes you say things and then you don't really mean them.
  What? Are you serious?!| I'm just not sure I wanna get married in such a hurry. What if she's just after my  Demonic Wishing Eye and Ghost pouch? 
  We just took you out partying so that you could feel better about getting hitched!| Maybe I'll just go back to capturing lots of girls. It's what I feel comfortable doing, y'know? Being free, wind at my back, lots of girls, kidnapping 'em.
  Watch.  Let big brother handle this.  Hey, Ice King? Don't be nervous. Marriage is the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to a jerk like you.| Really? Why?
  Not now!  Why, why, why, why, why?| My mind is made up—80% sure. No marriage.
  Well, uh... don't you wanna grow old with somebody? Right?  Just like these old swans.| Bleh, those stinky old swans. Huh?
  What?!| Ohhhh, now I get what you guys are trying to tell me! Marriage is a thing that allows me to capture a princess forever and let her live inside of me!  Marriage is the most beautiful thing in the world!
  Eh, let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Look how happy he is.| The wedding? Back on—100%! 
  | Finn, Jake, you made it!  Come on up here. I'm almost finished tying up my bride.
  Weird—and your bride is into that?| This is a traditional wedding ritual for good luck in the Ice Kingdom. You see, she'll be hoisted up and then lowered down—and when she touches my beard from above, she will be my queen! 
  Well...  cool, man. I'm glad y'all are happy... being crazy together.| Thank you! Excuse me as we finish preparing for the nuptials. 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, uh—
  32.| Yes—32, 64, one hundred and—eh.
  That's what cursed her! Don't worry, princess. I'll remove this ring and save your life. | No! She's my love boat! 
  No, man. You cursed her. She hates you!| Okay, that's your opinion! 
  Wait a minute!  So you knew she was cursed all along, which means you knew she wasn't trying to steal your Demonic Eye Junk or whatever, and you knew you had total control of her!| Yeah, yes, that's right.
  So then why did you make us go through all that junk about why marriage is worth stuff?!| Oh, I don't know... I'm complicated—and spontaneous!  That's probably why she wants to marry me!
  She wants to marry you because you brainwashed her!| Silence! 
  Whoa, wait!  Aw, man!| It's time for the lowering ceremony! Hoist her up!
 Other| Hehehehe! Commence the lowering!
 Other| Yes, nothing can stop me now.
  Hyah!  What is wrong with you, man?! | Strangling the groom's nose at a wedding?  What's wrong with you?! You're the one that there's something wrong with!
   Ehh.|  I think you dropped something.  Catch! 
  Oh, good.| Now, let's try that again.  Lower her!
   You lousy, butt-faced pig! I hate you!| Here she comes. Yes, touch my beard, deary. Yes, that's right. Almost there...
  | Oh! I'm married, right, snowman?
  It's official! You done married a dog, dude!| What? What's that supposed to—  Oh no.
  Well, I wouldn't say everything.|  Come on, guys. Help me celebrate my un-marriage.
   Keep your crummy soul!| Gunter! Who told you you could fly?!
   Wenk.| Huh? No one sucks the life from my penguins except me! ...And maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter.  You darest encroach upon my domain?!  You've raised my frosty dander! And for that, I shall—  AAAAAOOOOOHHH!! I've soiled my tunic... completely by choice! 
  We rescued Wildberry Princess from the Ice King.| I just wanna be happy!
  The Ice King?!| I should go.
  You were spying on us?!| That's none of your business!
  It's none of your business how nude I sleep, Ice King! Nnnnone of your business!| Gentlemen, I'll see you later.
  Tell us why you were spying!| NO!
  Ow! Ouch! Ow! Hey! Hey!| Is that all the ice ya have?
  Yeeesss!| Well, you should really have more.
  We don't need any more.| What if you had guests?
  Yeah and make it quick 'cause we're both really sleepy.| Ok, ok, I'll tell you! I was watching you... to learn how to be happy.
  Huh?| It's true! I would like to be happy like you guys. But, I have no idea how.
  So, you dressed up like a horse?| Have pity on me.  I've been so sad and miserable, I cry all the time. But, whenever I see you two, you always look so happy.
  So yes, I've decided to spy on you, dressed as a horse. | But, I guess my plan failed. All I observed was you two arguing over...how to get rid of me.
 Other| Hey, are you sleeping?  Is this it? Sleeping? Could it be that all I need is a good night's rest? 
 Other| Ahh... I'm... still not happy.
   Hi!| Beautiful princess.
  Excuse me for approaching you, sir. You just seem so approachable. |  That's funny, usually my looks put people off.
  |  Is someone paying you to do this?
   Tell me about yourself.| Well, there's not much to tell, really. I'm an ice king.
  Oooh, a nice King.| Ha haha, no no, dear you misheard me. I'm not a nice king, I'm a—  A really nice king! And I'm single!
  Yoo hoo! Nice King, Nice King over here!| Ladies, I'll have time to meet you individually later, please just, just stop squirming.
  But this looks like a prison.| Prison? Don't be ridiculous! It's a... waiting room! Stop squirming.
   Nice King! Yeeeaah! | Finn and Jake! You'll never take me alive! 
  You're the nice king, right?|  Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that.
  Well, we will honor and serve you.| Serve me?
  Yeah! We wanna be your nice knights.|  Sounds... nice...
  | With my rod of niceness, I dub thee two my Nice Knights. 
  Nice King!|  Please! I'm trying to tell my Nice Knights something! 
 Other|  Come here.  The main enemy to the Nice King right now is the disorganization of his love life.
  W-well, what do you mean?| The ugly ones are all mixed up with the other ones! I need you to catalog them... or something.
  Tah ha, but we punch monsters.| After I choose my bride, then you can go punch the monsters.
  Can't argue with that!|  Hey, Nice Knights, Turtle Princess is about to walk out that door, I told her that I like her a lot, but I really don't like her all that much, could you guys break it off for me?
  Nice King, may I speak with you for a moment?| Princesses, I must speak with my knight in private. Go on back into your cage.
  Bye, Nice King. | What's up, knight?
  I don't like treating princesses this way, I don't wanna... I don't wanna do this anymore.|  Your loyalty is in question?
  Oh, it's not that. It's just, princesses are suppose to be treated with niceness.|  Are you implying that I'm not the nice king!
  Hey, what's wrong with you!| 
  Hey, I'm here.| Ugh, Finn, get rid of her.
  What?! No, man!| She's too loud and lumpy, I like smooth princesses... smoo-o-o-oth. 
  I can't punch a princess!| Gaah! Finn, just punch her! Let me see what she looks like... smoo-o-o-oth.
  Princess no!| Wait a minute Nice Knight, let's see what she can do. 
  There, how's that? Better? | Meh, no, I-I don't like her.
  King, I'm sorry, I just can't do this anymore| Hey! You're on thin ice Nice Knight! 
  Huh?|  The jig is up!
  What jig?| Ah, eh, heh heh, my jig is up. Up high! It's a highland jig.  And I have a new assignment for you, one with more knight related stuff, very important.
  Oh, wow, awesome! What is it?| The Ice King stole my razor, sneak into his trap-filled ice castle and retrieve it.  And don't look through the shoebox he keeps behind the laundry bag in the closet.
  Wha?!| Those are my orders!
   Get ready, Ice King, for battle!|  And once I have my razor, I can select my elite army of wives and take over the world!
   Nice King!| Did you retrieve my stole razor?!
  Yeah and also this! | My beard! I-I-I mean what is that?!
  |  Wait, I can't fly!
  | N-no, wait!
  Yaaaaaaa!  Now fly, ya liar! | Ugh!  Oh, eh?  Ladies, ladies, heh heh, I can shave it off again, a-and when you get fat, I'll grow it back! Eh! 
 Finn, I think I'm gonna take off my booties. I can't flip these pages.|Gunter, let's go! I've got the overnight bag.
  A secret hidden room full of ninja stuff!| Oh, great—a line.  Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.
 Uhh, I-I think you were actually ahead of me.| You know I was.   Counter maid, I demand medical attentions,  preferably those of a princessy type.
 And are you checking in as a patient or a cadaver?|Hey! I'm as healthy as ten old men!
 Other|Ah! Oh, oh, right!  My penguin—he's very, very sick. So... what time does your shift end?
 Jake! Show me how to do that.|What's taking that doctor so long? Gunter, make more noise!
 WUAH! WUAH!|Yeah, alright. Don't oversell it, drama queen.
 Dun, dun, dunnn. Pardon the intrusion. I'm Doctor Princess.|Yes, well, uh...  Come to Ice King, Princess.
  Don't worry, sir. I specialize in treating little tuxedo people.|Just give it to me straight, doc. Am I gonna have to pay for this?
 Oh, my!|What can you do for him, Doctor Princess?  Without Gunter, I'll be all alone. You see, I'm a widower.
 Oh, I'm sorry. How did your wife die? |Oh, what? Is that what that means? 
 Whoa, Nelly! Something medical is happening!|Gunter, you're embarrassing me!
 It's the Ice King! Hide!| Okay, m'dear, this enclosure will be your new home!
 Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice! |...but once you get used to the smell of penguin manure, it's almost tolerable.
 Ice King, hand over that princess!|Princess? What?
 Ooh, right.|What princess?
 Yeah, the one you just came back from stealin'.|Wrong-o. I was at the hospital, for it turns out Gunter here was preggers!
 Wenk.|I was just talking to the egg! It's such a cutie!
 Gunther's a woman?!|What? No!  Fuh. Anyway, get out of my house or I'll kill you, et cetera. I want to take a nap in my easy chair.  What happened to my recliner?!
 Ohh...|My skins and tubs!
 |You even violated my secret sanctum?! What is wrong with you?!
 No princess?|No! No princess!
 We messed up, Jake. We're... violators!|Yeah, what the heck?! You think you can just wreck my house and wear my collectibles?!  Hah! Who do you guys think you are?!
 We're... ninjas?|You're not ninjas! You're just a couple of jerks!
 It's true.  Ice King, we're gonna make this right.|Yeah, do it; make it right. And start by, uh... oh, take my bag over to the cage.
 Other|Oh, no, no, no! Not that! Never mind! Put that down and go clean my gym equipment.
 Doctor Princess!| Oh, heh... I have no idea how that got in there!
 I'll field that one.  The Ice King abducted me while I was distracted by the horrifying beauty of birth.|Yes, Gunter's ailment was the perfect cover for stealing a princess, M.D.
" I'm not even a real princess. ""Princess"" is just a surname. "|Enough! You may have uncovered my princess-smuggling scheme, but you'll never leave this place alive!
  A couple of ninjas like me and Finn can only be defeated by another ninja!|Doot, doo, doooo!  Ninja!
 Oh.| Gunter! Why didn't you tell me?
   Weh-weh-wenk.|Oh, Gunter...
  What is wrong with you?!|  What's wrong with me?!  No!  Not the latch!
  Run through it, man!  We gotta get beyond Iceberg Lake before the Lich!| Oh, my! How clumsy of me!
  What the heck, Ice King?!| Hey, wait, you guys! I'm serious about Bubblegum! Look, I wrote her name all over my arms and legs! 
  Yugh!| Guys! It's not fair! She always hangs out with you, and it's not like you wanna marry her!
   Why are you following us?! | Whoa!  I told you already. I want your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum!  Come on, guys, give me permission to marry her! I'll... I'll do a little dance for you!  Hmm? You like this?
  No!|  Oh, come on! If you bless our wedding, then maybe she'll really love me.
   Ice King, go away, man.| I will! When you bless our wedding!
  Let's blow this stand!|  I tried to do this right, but you've driven me to this—driven me to bad doing.
  Oh, Finn and Jake, please be okay.  Please be okay... please be okay...| Eh... stupid thing... come on... eh...
  Ice King?! Get outta here!!| I didn't want to do this, but by not blessing our wedding, Finn and Jake have forced me to kidnap you.
  That's insane!| I know! But I'll show them... I'll show them how they've hurt us!
  Ah, yeah, haha! Closing in... Gonna get you, man!  Closer, Jake!  Closer... closer...| Ah!
  PRINCESS?! NO!| Oh, no.  Oh, gross. This water stinks.
   ICE KING!!| Look! Look what you've made me do to her!
  Don't worry, Princess!| Hey, where're you guys goin'? What's goin' on?
   Shhhh...|  Yep! Holes are holes! NYEH!! 
  Oh, Finn... you did it!| We did? Hey, yeah, we did it!! Oh, you guys! This experience has brought us all so much closer together! Princess, I'm sorry for all of this. I love you, and I've decided to set you free.  Go free!!
 Other| Uh... Whoops, I've got the dropsies!
   Yes, I'm fine. I just need to rest.|  Oh, my wife! Is there anything weird about her? I can't see through these pain tears!
  She's fine. Why?| It's just that... after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen. Something I still don't understand.  Ooh—AGH! Wait! Listen to me!!
  NO! Just shut your mouth, old man!|" ""Old man?"" Heh! What? I'm not old."
  Uh, yeah, you are, dude.| Old? I'm... I see. It's all making sense now. Brrrrapapo!  I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess.  Nobody in the world.
   JUST GET OUT OF HERE!!| Peace.
  Evil presence detected!!  Must defend!!|  Hey, Finn, are you dead or what?
   Whaaah?... Ice King? What are you doing here?| Hey. I had to keep an eye on the princess because she's being possessed by the Lich.
   You don't know that.| But I do. I saw it with my wizard eyes!  In the well, I saw something come out of the Lich and go into the princess. But I wasn't sure it was real  because when you have stanky old wizard eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like crazy crazy crazy in your face all the time!   All the time...  Guys, let me help you. I don't want my future wife to be... physically unattractive.
  Urrgh...  Liking her... didn't work. She's unstoppable... unless...   Ice King, I... I need you to freeze Princess Bubblegum. Will you help me?|  Are you suuuuure?
   Yes.| Great! Weeee! 
  I'll distract 'er up top, you freeze 'er legs!|  Wah!
  I'M A CAT! I'M AN AGILE CAT! JAKE! DUCK!  MEOW, ICE KING!  Thanks, bird!| Yeah! Whoopie!
  You did good, Ice King.| Oh, yeah?
  Yeah, man.| Okay. I didn't kill 'er this time. Everybody saw that, right?
  Yes... I'm afraid... there wasn't enough gum to work with, so it appears Princess Bubblegum is now...... younger.  She's 13 years old now.| Aw, dang it! Well, I'm outta here. Goodbye, everyone. 
  Show me where to start.| Huh? Who could that be? 
  I command you to make me a sandwich!| What?! No one commands the Ice King to make no sandwich!
   What about now?|  Okay.
  Ice King?! How many times have we warned you about using love potion?| That's why I'm using honey.
   Yeah, you stink so much I'm gonna ground you for a week!| What? You can't do that!
  You're grounded for two weeks!| You're grounded for two weeks!
  Oh, snaps!| Why? I didn't do anything.
  Four weeks?|  Fine. But I'm only gonna do it for a week.
  Oh, dang!|  Okay.  What's up with the peace sign?
  Awesome. | This is so unfair! They're the ones who should be grounded. Not me!  I'm so mad! I could just hit them! If only I could hit them without leaving the castle.   H...I...T...M...A...N.  Ooh! [A profile pops up. It is the Scorcher's profile. It reads
   No!| You guys, I—
  Oh, great. Now see what you did to my buddy? So help me, Ice King.| Okay, okay. Goll. 
  It's alright, buddy. We can make another. | Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got some weird ideas about hitting.
 Other| Hey, there you are! What's that? I already signed that.  I thought I told you to hit them, not burn them alive! You big dummy! Goll! It's almost like you want to kill them! Lucky for them, I stopped the fire!  You know what happens when you're burned alive?! Your eyeballs explode! Bleh!  Hey wha—?
   Meat Man. Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man, I didn't mean it, man. | Finn and Jake, I am just a dream. I was never here...
 Other| Okay, mister, you are really trying my patience. How clear can I be?! All I want you to do is hit them. On the shoulder or something.  Are you even listening? Oh, I get it.  Here's double the grease to not kill Finn and Jake.  You trying to hustle me, Scorcher? Okay, I'll play this game. How about this prized piece for your pad?   No! Okay, how about these bad boys? Night-vision x-ray goggles. For when you have a lady house-guest.  Oh, come on!  At least renegotiate the target! You can destroy my least favorite princesses.  What about Lumpy Space Princess?  Ghost Princess?  I can't even hold her with my love mitts.  Aw, geez! Uh...  Oh! A—A leg cramp! In my leg! Ow, ow, ow.  Oh, this is so embarrassing. I'll be right back!   Ow, ow, ow!  Huh. Think, baby, come on. Ah!  Alright, let's hit the hitman, right? There's gotta be a—  Ah! [A profile for 'Blastronaut' comes up. It reads
 Other| No! Come back, you wussy!  Ooh, that was weird.  Was that your friend, or something?  Look, a super model! Look, a hover-board! Look, the apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boing-loins! Hit in the boing-loins!  Boing-loins! Boing-loins. Somebody got hit in them.  Peace out! 
 Other| Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt!
  You're grounded!| I know, but shush!
 Other| Okay, I hired a guy to kill you by accident.
  What?!| I thought he was going to just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch.  Well, I froze him in ice, but I think he's free now 'cause he's made out of fire. Or he commands fire, maybe?
  Jake, do something. He's getting close!| You alive?
  Uh, I think so.| Whew! That was close.
  What do we do?|  Ooh, got it! I'm gonna kill you guys!
  Hey, I'll kill you!| No, wait a minute, you two. I won't actually kill you. I'm just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead. And after we fool that fool outside, I'll warm you up, good as new.
  Yeah, we don't trust you!| You'll thank me later.
 Other|  Stop! Time out! You don't need to do this anymore! Look! They're dead! I killed them myself!  Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead! They're dead. No pulses.
 Other| So, uh, looks like, you can go home now.
 Other| Oh, yes, of course.  There. [The Scorcher burns the contract and disappears in a black vapor. He leaves a paper that reads
 What did you do to us, Ice King?|"Whoa, whoa. I didn't ""do"" anything to you, okay? C'mon, guys, I'm your friend."
 So why can't we move?|Ooh, because I froze you... with this. 
  Freezing Potion A.|I sprayed it on you while you slept.
  Wenk! Wenk!|No! Gunter, no! This one likes to break bottles, don't ya?  Tuck-ety tuck! Let's move to the living room.
 Why are you doing this, Ice King?|Why? Oh, because I love you guys. But you don't love me, do ya?
 You tried to kill us, like, four times.|I only try to kill you 'cause you're princess-blocking me all the time! Anyway, now that you're frozen, we can bond and stuff. And the sooner we do, the sooner I can spray you with this. 
  Unfreezing Potion A?|"Ah, I underlined the ""un"" so I wouldn't mix 'em up."
 Yeah, 'cause we're already friends.|We are?
 Mm-hmm.|What's my favorite color?
 Um, ooh, uh... rainbow?|You don't love me. I know a lot about you guys. Jake, you don't put ice in your drink because you have sensitive teeth.
 Wha—?|And Finn, your favorite food is meatloaf.
 How did you—?|And Jake, sometimes you don't cry because you're afraid of real emotion. It's okay. Let it out.  You don't love me—  Bad penguin!
 You lock your bottles?|Huh, in this economy?  Ah, I'm gonna go make some lemonade. 
  Come to me, Astral Beast...|I've got lemonade! You want some, Jake?
 Other|Huh? Gunter...  No, Gunter! No bottles. Look at me.
 Wenk!| What am I gonna do with you?  You're going to have to wear a leash.  This should keep you out of trouble.  Now, our first bonding activity will be walking in each other's shoes—so to speak. To better understand each other's perspectives, we're going to dress up like each other. Me first!
 Other| It's adventure time! I'll save you, Princess! Let's have babies, Princess, and let's teach them to be good babies! Oh, Princess, sure, I'll kiss you. I'm a hero. Hey Finn, don't you think it's weird there's two Finns? Finn?  Not talking? Now, I'm gonna dress like Jake. 
 Noooo! No, no, no, no, no!|Okay, okay! We'll bond in another way.
 Other|"So, I wanted to show you something telling of my soul. I take artful black and white photographs of my penguins' body parts. Photography is art; let's see some art.  Okay, first one. See how Gunter is staring into the camera? He's saying, ""Here I am. Look at me. Accept me."" Okay, second one.  This is a haunting image of a penguin's flipper. Look at how it penetrates the negative space. Oh yes, this one is very—"
 Astral Beast! Where are you? You come here NOW!  Wheee...!|...Yeah, I've thought about it a lot, and having a little gallery show might be nice. A little cheese, a little cider... could be nice, y'know?  Maybe bring a veggie plate? I think people would appreciate that.
  Key! Gunter. Gunter. Psst! Pssssst. Come here, Gunter. | This next one is very rewarding...
  Gunter! Come back.|Gunter!
  Weeenk.| You are being naughty, Gunter. You've interrupted my thing.  Now you stay right here and go to sleep.  Sleep.  Aw. So cute. Alright, back to art.
  Gunter. Gunter, wake up.  Go... get... the... key.  Consarn it, Gunter!|Okay, time for a break. Who wants lemonade?  Ooh, don't want to lose this.  Gunter! Jake! No! You're bonding without me.
 Wenk.| It's for your own good, sweetie.  Now then. 
 Wait, you're sleeping up here?!|Well...  not before our next bonding activity
 Uh, yeah, my girlfriend? Lady Rainicorn?|Ohhhhhh! Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.  Know who I have a crush on?  Princess Bubblegum.
  You don't say.|Oh, I do. I've liked her for quite some time. Feels weird to say it out loud. 
  The Astral Beast cometh.|" Who's ""hungie""? Jake, you ""hungie""?"
 I'm hungry.|Alright, fair enough. Well, how 'bout I make us some omelettes?
 That sounds pretty good, actually.|I'm gonna put my foot in it. Eating a part of me will bring us closer together.  I'll be inside of you! 
  No... you... don't!| Well, I don't want to use too much foot. It'll overpower the eggs. Take away from the omelette.  Huh? Aah!
 Other|Finn! and Jake! and a bunch of butterflies! and a sword!
 Other|What do you want from me?
 What do we wa—? We want you to unfreeze us, you lunatic!|No! We're not friends yet. You haven't eaten my omelette. 
 Friends don't eat each other, Ice King. That's not how friends work. Now unlock this bottle and unfreeze us.|Oh, alright. I don't know how you're doing this, but it is impressive.
 Other|Wait a minute... which bottle is thi—?  I think they brought me the wrong bottle. Gunter's still upstairs.  Gunter! Gunter! Gunter! Gunter!!
  You're a contestant?!| Mm-hmm. You guys come here to watch me win?
  You're a loser.| Ha! I'm not gonna lose! I've got a foolproof plan for winning.  I'm gonna cheat. 
  No one is allowed to exit Wizard Battle!  The doors are shut.  The sky barrier is in place. All of you will kiss the princess or die in battle.| Ooh, I just can't wait to taste that sweet Bubblegum. 
  Over there!|  Oh, yeah.
  Oh, okay.| Yeaah!
  Why isn't the Grand Master Wizard seeing this?| Nun-chucks vanish!  Boo yah!
  Three wizards remain. Time to get real. I wanna see some crazy wiz biz!| Wiz biz! Wiz biz! Oh, I can almost taste those sweet lips. 
   Quick, listen! Now's the time for you to help me. | Hey, guys. Guys? What are you whispering? Come on! I gotta a surprise for yous fools.
 Other| Yeah. That's right. Just a little closer.  Ooh, what's in here? In my little sleevey hole? 
   Watch out, man.| Whoo!
  You got this, Danny boy!| My nun-chucks! Nooo!!
  Yes!  I did it! I really did it. I'm a true wizard.| I have powers too, you butts! Yahh! Ice sword!  Ice Shield! 
  Abracadaniel! | Wha? What you say?  B'oh! 
  So fly.|"  How 'bout me? Put me on the grid, scale of one to ten. One is ""totally gross,"" ten is like, ""Dang, Ice King. You look crazy sick."""
  Ice King is the hottest hottie, and I can't wait— |" ""—to marry him!"" said Fionna. Then she turned to Prince Gumball and said, ""I hope Ice King will sweep me off my feet and take me to the farthest corner of Ooo, where we will do nothing but kiss and eat a whole bunch until we get fat and die."" The end. So, what do you think of the fanfiction I wrote about you guys?"
  Uh...|  Tell me you thought it was good!
  Ice King, this the last time you steal our sandwiches!| You don't understand! If you were me, you would do things I would do!
  Yeah, and if you were us, you'd kick your fat butt!| I ... yeah, I would... but I wouldn't get past my invincible armor!
  Yaah! |  Not a scratch, boys! Not a scratch! It's my time to shine!
  | Fools! Fools! You're wasting your ti-yime!
 Other|  In-ice-able vince armor...
  Yeah!| Aah! You can have the sandwiches back! I'm sorry! Help!
  Bye-bye.| Boy, those sandwiches look really cool!  It looks like it'd be really awesome to try a bite of one of those  ... right on, right on.
  Yup.| You know ... maybe we could all learn a thing or two from those sandwiches.
  Wenk. | Gunther? Hey, Gunther. Get-get away from the camera, sweetie. Papa's recording his innermost thoughts. 'Member? I explained this to you?  Hey, Gunther?  GUNTHER!!!
  Wenk.|  Well, anyway, as you can see, I'm not wearing my—
  Wenk.|  I'm not wearing my—
  Wenk wenk.| Sweetie, I raised my voice because you were giving me the silent treatment. You understand?
  Wenk.| I love you.
  Wenk.| I know. You don't like when I'm contemplative. ...C-contemplative... No, con-temp-la—Let's put on a play!
  Wenk. Wenk wenk. | No, Gunther, beard stays on.
  Wenk.| Gunther, I need ya to wear the beard!
  Wenk!| Gunther!
  Wenk.|"  Now hold still...  You moved! Hey, what's this?  ""Secret tapes""?! I wanna watch! I'll catch ya later, Gunther! "
   You're Gunther. | Oh, fine! Who needs you? More dance party for us, right, Gunther?  Oh... Eh...  May I have this dance? Heh! 
  Cool.| Hey, guys, it's me. Can I come in and watch the secret tapes with you? I brought some gifts! 
  Okay. If we're quiet long enough, Ice King will think no one's home and go away.| Eh... No one's home. Guess I'll go away. 
 Other|  Huh?
  Just turn your alarm off!| Hmm. That sounds like BMO! 
  Hey, Princess. We got disconnected.|  Hello, Finny. 
  Hey/Uhhh, you sound weird!| Must be a bad connection. That's why we were disconnected earlier on the telephone.
   So... how's the weather in Candy Kingdom?|  Oh, the usual. There's ice everywhere and it smells like penguins!
  The only thing that smells like penguins is you, Ice King!!|  How did you—
  What're you doing?!| I wanna watch secret tapes with you guys. It'll be nice.
  No, man!| But—
   He doesn't know that we're watching his tapes. We gotta find these evil secrets before he uses them against us!| Oh... Fine. No more nice. NOW YOU GET ICE!!  Try watching those tapes with FROZEN EYEBALLS!
  Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here.|  Agh... What's on those tapes...? I can kinda... make it out... Dang it, BMO, just turn to your right a little.... Ugh!! By the power of ice... I want your cup of cocoa to fall over.  Yes! Now turn and pick it up...  Yes... Yes...  That's... me?  THEY'RE WATCHING MY SECRET TAPES?!  And they're cozy. I'll show them.  This snowman looks pretty good.  Pretty darn good! 
  Oh, my Glob, Jake... Is this it? Could this be the Ice King's evil secret?   WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!| Some of you won't survive this. You'll melt or split in half or your head will fall off... but that's fine... because you're made of snow. Only one thing matters today! Getting into that tree house, getting my tapes back, and beating up Finn and Jake!  Maybe BMO. Yeah, BMO too! Who's with me?!  Hey, why're you guys so quiet? Are you mad?  Oh, that's right. You're not alive yet. My bad.
 Other| Gimme my tapes back.
  No, man! I know you've got evil secrets on these, and we're gonna find 'em!| Snowmen! Attack!
  Please! Let me go home!|"  So, Princess ""Please-let-me-go-home,"" what was it like to experience this tragedy?"
  What?  I... I don't... uh... um...| Yeah, we're on air, honey, so spit it out.
  I... I don't know what you're talking about.| Obviously traumatized and in a state of shock. Let's go ask somebody else something.  Upside-down Princess, do you think things will change politically because of today's events?
  You're really frightening me.| Well, there ya have it, folks. People are very upset that Gunther tried to eat Ice King's socks! Very upset! That's why Gunther has to stay in the corner! 
  Weird...  He's sneakin' in through the chimney!| Ah... The element of surprise... Ah, jeez, I'm filthy.  Well, now I'm cleaner, but I'm also nakeder.  Ohh! Mmm...  Just what I need...  Hehehehe...  Come on, come on!
  Yeeeesh.....|  They wouldn't be in the fruit bowl!  Ohhh! Well, look at you with your nose shining so bright! You're so unique! Hehe! I'll name you Red-nose, and make you leader of the pack!  Eh... Well, now you look boring.  You want somethin' done right, ya gotta do it yourself. 
 Other| Now gimme my evil tapes back!! They're supposed to be buried!! In the ground!!  Snow goons!!
  Play it! His evil secret must be on that tape!!|  No, BMO, please don't play it.
  Hello. My name is Simon Petrikov. I am recording this tape so that people will know my story.| Oh, no! Turn it off, BMO, turn it off!!
  Drrr-AMA bomb!!| Now you know my secret! You know... that I used to wear glasses!  Maybe kidnapping Wildberry Princess will cheer me up.
  Wait, Ice King.  BMO, eject tape, please.  Here, Ice King.| What's this? You're giving me... a gift.
  No... It's... well... These belong to you.| But it's not even my birthday! This is so exciting!  Video tapes! Heh, you know, I had a bunch of these once, but I threw them away! This is great, Finn! Thank you!
  It's from me, too.| Oh! I have presents for you guys, too!  Here. It's a small pine tree. I chopped it down in one foul swoop! And this  is for you!
   Uh... thanks.| Oh, isn't this fun?! We're giving each other presents, we're wearing silly clothes, there's snow everywhere... Let's do this every day!
  How about once a year?| Okay, that sounds good.
  Thanks, Princess. Peace out.| Blegh, Gunter, something stinks!  Gunter, do you smell that?  GUNTER, STOP PLAYING THE KEYBOARD!!  Smells like it's comin' from...  Gunter, are you blowin' it up in here?  You are nasty, Gunter! You got a nasty booty, mister! Nasty!  Oh, don't be sad, stinky. Come with daddy and I'll make it aaaall better.
 Other| Goodbye, Gunter. Sorry, sweetie, but I'm never gonna get any princesses if you're stinkin' up the place!  Blaaaah, it still stinks in here! What the heck! Where's that smell comin' from?!  Oh, it's me. I smell horrible.
 Other| Scrub, penguins! Scrub harder! We are not stopping until the stench is completely gone!
 Other|  Clean clean, clean ka-clean.  Gunter! Guess what? It was me who was smelly, not you!
   Wenk.| Sorry. I thought you had a stank booty, Gunter. My bad. Although I have no idea how my armpits got so stinky.
  Stop lying! We found your fingerprints at the crime scene!|  What? Really?
  Uuh... no.| Oh, well...then...why would you say that?
  Ice King, we know you did it!| Finn, I'm as concerned as you are. There's some sicko out there... What if he comes after my princess?
  Your princess?| Yeah... let me introduce you to my new wife.  Oh, wait...you mean I'm the guy stealing all the p— Yeah, okay, I get it now.
  What happened to them, husband?| Hmmm... mmm aah! They're sleepy. They are our limp sleepy children! Come on wife, let's have a nice family meal.
  Okay.| Wife, you sit here. Isn't this nice?
 Other| Uh oh... I mean, that's good!  Oops! How fun! You're so fun!
  Hahahahaha!| Aww... marriage is fun!
 Other| See, when you wash and I dry, we get done faster! Then tomorrow night we switch!
 Other| Here, let me show you a trick, my darling. See, you let it soak and we'll wash it in the morning.
 Other| Enough chores... come along, dear. I want to show you something special...
 Other| Here it is. I hope you like it...
  Is there something wrong with me? The way I am...it's not normal... is it?| Oh... pretty baby wife. You're the most normal thing in my whole life. We're like two normal jelly beans sitting at the bottom of the jar, floating in a sea of olives, waiting for somebody to guess how many jelly beans are in the jar... which I mentioned.
  I don't think I understand...| Just look into my eyes and know that everything is okay.
 Other| Are you feeling normal yet?  Okay.  See that? We're normal, just like the normal people are.
   Monster!| Oh... don't mind the kids! It's just a phase!
  I need a glass of water.| Ooh, I'll go get—
  You are not normal! You are a  monster!|  Hey, hey, hey....
  Monster! A monster!| What's going on in here? Nobody's a monster! All I see in this room is a young, kind-hearted, intelligent, hot-looking ice king, and his beautiful princess bride! That's you, sweetie...
  I don't feel beautiful. I feel like a freak!| I will prove to you that you are beautiful!
 Other| To me, my penguins! Gunter, Gunther, Gunder, Goonder, come on! Gunter, Goonthy, Gonter, Ginthy, follow!
 Other| Don't rearrange the chairs please. You're all gonna clap and cheer or I'm gonna smack your buns.  Whoo! Yeah! ...
  Where is she? Oh! I think she's right over...| Hey!
 Other| Baby, do you want to talk about it?
  You should just find another princess to marry. I'm unlovable!| Girl, I love you as much as all of the other princesses in the world combined!
  You don't really mean that...| I'll prove it! See, you have Elbow Princess's hips, and Dr. Princess's heart and intestines, Slime Princess's bottom... You have all my favorite parts of my favorite princesses!
   I'm just a bunch of stolen parts?!| Oh, the parts don't matter. It's you that matters.
  But... who am I?| You're my wife! And I will always love my wife no matter what!
  You'd love me, even without these other princess's parts?| Sure, baby, even without all your fine lady parts. Now give us a hug.
  Your wife's face can't make us faint anymore!| Don't listen to them babe; they're being negative! Run, my happiness! I'll distract them with ice magic!
  Do you give up?!| Yes! I give up...
  Huh?| Let me go! Let me go!
  Though my parts be scattered, I will always be your wife.| She... she... gave away all my stuff!
   It's just a dumb old leaf, ya dumb old Ice King.|  I know, but it's mine.
  Wait! What?! Ice King! You can hear me?| Yes... Why? Are you makin' fun of me or something?
  No, it's just no one else can see me or hear me talk.| Ohhhh, yeah.... You're trapped in the Spirit Realm. I can see all things Spirit with my... Wizard Eyes!
  Man... Never thought I'd be happy to talk to you, Ice King. Can ya help me get free??| Oh, yeah, I know all the ins and outs. And I'd do anything for a friend like you.
  Wenk.| Quiet, Gunter. Can'tya see I'm hanging with Finn?
  Wenk wenk.| I know I say that a lot, but this time it's true!
  Anyways... Where do all these spirits come from?| Oh, there are portals all over the universe. I have one in my basement! Every once in a while, a real cutie pie drifts through. Ooh!  Oh, gosh, there she is.  Mm, oh, yeah... 
  Sick.| What? I swear I never touch 'em! I can't!  Can't touch this, can't touch this...  Can't touch this, either.  Yep, I can't kill any of them.   I hate them... Okay, alright! 'Nuff messin' around. Let's getcha free from the Spirit Plane.
  Cool.| Sooo, the only way to get out of the Spirit World is to stick all these lousy things in the Spirit Hole down there. Then plug up the hole with that.
  And doing that will set me back to normal??| Mm-hmmmm, trust me! We are tur-bros! Turbo bros! Tur-bros. Turbo. ...Bros.
  I... did it.  I did it. I'm ready, Ice King. Make me normal now.| Ohhh, that's not all of 'em. There's this other guy that watches me. He's... super creepy.  Do ya see it?? Oh, it see's you...  Catch it and put it in the Spirit Hole! In the Spirit Hole where it can't see me anymore so you can be free!!  Get it! Get it!!  GET IT IN THE HOLE!!
   Ew! Ew! Ew!  Eeeewwww!! | Yes! It's gone!
  So... now I can go back to normal.| Uhhh, wait, though.
  ...What?| There's this last guy you gotta get. He's pretty much the worst. He usually leaves these gross heads around, but I'm not seeing them anywhe— OH!  THERE IT IS! THERE IT IS!!
  Wanwan. Wanwan. Wanwan.|  Nooo...
  Wanwan! Wanwan!| NO! DON'T COME NEAR ME!!
  What is that?| It's from the dead one. He leaves these heads around everywhere. I can't even touch them, but it still creeps me out...
  Wanwan!| Please get rid of him!
  What do I do? Follow the heads?|  USE THE HEADS!! Oh, snow, please!
  Oh, my what? The cave?? How the...??? ...Weird. That's weird, but whatevs, though.  Whatevs. Ice King! Ice Kiiiing!  Where'd you go, Simon?  Ice King?  Dude, come on, what?| Ha ha, Finn! You fell right into for my brilliant plan  that I formed out of the thin air like a true Magi! Not only did I get you to remove those horrible creatures from my castle, but now you're trapped, and only I can see you. So if you want friends, this is it, pal! 
   I'm gonna re-open the hole.| NO, WAIT, MY PLAN FELL APART!!  My... new plan is that you don't open the hole, and I destroy the porcelain lamb which will bring you back to the material plane. Heh heh... heh.
 Other| Jake.  AGH, BLUH! GIMME THAT LAMB!
  NO!!  Finn's trapped in here!!| That's why I have to smash it!!
  You donk! I will smash you!! WAAAH!! | Escaped!  AAAH! My winter body!! I was gonna start up on the elliptical again, but I got depressed, okay?! Don't look at me!! 
   Whoooo?!| AAH! They're touching me for real! EWW!!
  Great. Now we're both stuck in here.|  FINN, GIVE ME YOUR CLOTHES! 
  STOP! WUUH!| I need a buffer!! AAAH! 
  Ah, jeez, come on!|  I'm sorry... I'm sorry, they were just touching me on the body... I'm sorry... 
  Whoa, do that again.  Your hand is affecting the TV! We must have some kinda subtle effect on the material plane!| Cooool. Whaddaya think, Finn? Can we pull back the veil of static and reach into the source of all being? Behind this curtain of patterns... this random pattern generator... So clever... right here in every home, watching us from a one-sided mirror...  Heh heh heh, whoops! Just wizard-talkin' to myself!
  It's okay! But let's use our subtle influence to break the lamb!| Yeah, a'ight. You mean like this?
  Yeah, man! Bwoooo!  It's workin', man! Combine the swirls!| Okay! Wha-zah!!
 What did you say??|I really did it this time! They're loose, and they're coming for us!
 Other|Ach! Where the turd is my Demonic Wishing Eye?! Grrrr...  I've looked everywhere! Ugh...
 Wenk!|What is it, girl?
 Wenk. |You know where it is? Lead the way! Oh boy, this is just wonderful!  Hmnh.  Agh! You just want me to brush you! You know this brush is for princesses only?  Ah, princesses only. No Gunthers!
 Other| What are my options here? Hmm. Hm-hm.  Gunther! What is your damage today?  Ooh! Wizard market!  W-I-Z-...
 Other|Hey!  You're really peeving me off, Gunther! Go stand in the corner!
 Other|I said stand in the corner.
 Other|Ugh. You make me sick.  Try not to break anything while I'm gone.
 ICE KIIIIING! |Wizards rule.
 Other| Doot-doo, deet-dee-doo. Ah, let's see.  That's the symbol for magic items, right?  Hey, this is the magic items shop, right?
 What's it look like, ya donk?|I know that, I know! Why can't they write it on the sign, though? Why's it all gotta be secret? Let's just put it all out there, huh? Equal distribution of magic to the people!  No more symbols! No more initiations!  Ya feelin' me, Huntress Wizard?
  You tryin' to get killed, Ice King?|"Uh-uh, I was just steppin' to ya, girl, with my intellectual wizard politics.  No, don't go.  Well, ""Swing at every ball,"" that's what Jay T. Doggzone says.  Hello?"
 Of course, man. In shadow, we find the light...  safely sealed in darkest night. So make sure y'all keep it tight. Wizards only, fools.| Keep what tight?
 A secret you never should've heard, Ice King.| Yo. Guys. Chill. I lost my Demonic Wishing Eye.  Just get me a new one and I'll jet. I didn't hear nothin' about no weird, secret wizard club that I want to be a part of.
 Sorry, man.  Nothing personal.|Oh, slid—  You guys!  Ah!  Whoa!
  Goodbye... Princess!|Hey. What's goin' on here? Why's this place all crazy? I was just flying by and—  Gunther! You took my stuff!
 Wenk.|That's bad. You know what you get now?!
  Wenk.|That's right, you get the squirty-squirts.  Bad, bad. Now take off my Demonic Wishing Eye.
 Other|Alright, Gunther. Now go home.
  Wenk.|That's right, walk. And while you're walking home, you think about what you did.  It's getting worse and worse with him. He just—he hates it when I leave the castle. I'm sorry, guys.
 Yeah, and why are you all jacked up?|"Heh... well, I got into some crazy wiz biz over in Wizard City. Honestly, I don't even know how I survived. Basically, it was the craziest showdown ever. I— I wish I could tell you all about it, but you know—""Wizards only, fools."" Keep it tight."
  Wenk! | One, two, three...   Gunter!    It's rhetorical, Gunter. Marceline's songs are so good! Mmm... Maybe I can get Marceline to write a song with me!  Man, if she helped me write a song like that, I'd be crushin' it nonstop with the princesses! Ooh, yeah!  Heh! Gunter, you cute little dummy. You know, Gunter, my song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in. Hmm.
 Other|" Jay T. Doggzone always says, ""Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts."" And I've got a way tortured past! ...I think. I don't really... re...  Hmm.  Quickly, Gunter! To the ""The Past"" room!"
 Other| Lot of emotional, powerful stuff in here.  Still wet with tears... I'll take some-a' these for lyrical inspiration.  So where's Marceline living these days?
  Wenk.| A cave?? 
  Dinner roll!| Hello? Anybody home?
   No...  What are you doing here? I told you not to come around me!|  Uh, yeah, I know, but... I was hoping you could help me write a song—one that could help me get some princess action.
  I'm not gonna help you pick up on chicks!|  Come on! We could be a prog rock duo! I'll even split the fans with you. I get the princesses, and you get... whatever it is you're into. Sounds good, yeah, I think it does!  Ee-yoop!
   Hey!!| Eh...
  Get outta here!!| Wait! Just let me play you what I've written so far!   Oh. Dang it. Tangles in the cord. Sometimes this happens when you fly with it... Tangles are hard...  Oh. Aw, aw, geez, no... Oh, no.  Ice King's in trouble.    Hey, you know what? I'll just hum it for ya.  Is that good?
  Wha?!|" Yeah, ""Wha?!"""
  Bye... |  You know, I kinda like bein' tied up in these cords. Kinda freak-aaaayyy!
  So what kinda song're we playing?| Ooh. I brought these  for some inspiration. Just use these to work off of. Y'know, a template.
  Oookaaaay...| Yeah. Yeah, that's good! Keep doin' that!   Slime Princess, you're alright. Flame Princess, you're okay. Wildberry Princess could be better. All of the princesses are pretty alright, but... Oh, Bubblegum! You look like a lot of fun! I'm right outside, and that is how I know! Hey, princess, did you get my text with a picture of my awesome gun show? I'm also workin' on my pecs! If you like, I'll send a picture of that, too! Oh, Bubblegum!  I really need someone.  Or anyone!  ...Pretty much anyone. I'm so alone!  Won't somebody tell me what's wrong with me?!  Anybody!  Anybody!   Anybody!!!  Grod in the sky, please tell me why!!!
  Stop acting like this!!| No, it's just startin' to get good!!  Anybody!!  Princesses, I command you, love me!! Love me!! Love me!!  Love me!!
   STOP ACTING CRAZY.| I JUST WANNA BE LOVED!!  Uh-oh. I'm sorry I pushed you.  Uh... oh... I'll just stay out of your way.  Again, I'm sorry I pushed you.
  Huh?| Whatcha got? An apple?
   Ugh!   You're so annoying, you pitiful old man. I'd like to help you, but I don't know if I can. I thought you were nuts, but you're really really really nuts.  Every time I move, eventually, you find me, and start hanging around. Just another lame excuse to see me. Man. It's getting me down. You know, I'm actually glad... to see you!  Maybe I'm the one who's...  nuts.| Hold on!  Do you... like me?!
  ...Of course I do, you old jerk!| Really? ...Wow.  How about...  one of these?  Ah!  Mwah, mwah, mwah...
   AAAAAGH!!! Not like that!! You don't remember anything, do you... SIMON?| What-mon?
  Why do you even come see me when you don't remember me?! You don't even know who you are!| Yes, I do! I am a lyricist!  It's all here! On the page! The page in song, baby! On this receipt! On this takeout menu! On these newspapers! 
  Huh? Look! This clipping! This was you, Simon! Before the War!| Huh?  Heh?
  This! You took this picture! Grr, you've scribbled all over it... Huh? | Ooh, ooh, are they good lyrics?  I'll get the keyboard!
  What?  Wait, listen!|  Yeah, let's go! What's it say? Sing out, sister!
"   ""Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world? That must be so confusing for a little girl. And I know you're going to need me here with you... but I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're going to lose me, too..."""| Ooh, yeah! Keep it going! 
"   Oh! Um...  ""This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me  crazy, and I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please forgive me for whatever I do  ...when I don't remember you."""|  Wow! I wrote that?! Hot stuff!
  What?! You don't remember what it means?!  Look!|"  ""Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away. I can't remember what it made me say... but I remember that I saw you frown. I swear, it wasn't me. It was the crown.  This magic keeps me—"""
  Wenk!| Gunter! Huh?  Woo wowsers!
   Wonderful! |  Family meeting! Family meeting gather ‘round.  Things are gonna change around here very soon! You’re gonna have a new mommy to help BOSS ya around! Well, I mean- I haven’t exactly asked her yet. Welp! No time like the present!  Ya deh deh duh duh duh deh. Sweetie, are you awake?  Great! Because I have a query I’ve been meaning to inquire of you.  Well, uh.  When two people, eh- will- Will you marry me!  Oh yah!  Yes! Yes drink up the tears! Drink up those good luck tears!  No, not you Gunter! You’re on a low-salt diet! Huh?  Uh-a-what’s that dear? Oh! I almost forgot!  Do do-do do-Do!  It’s a wife ring!  This one’s for me. I’m the husband. That means I get the remote control THREE days a week and you get it four!   Ahhh, Sweetie, this is bliss. It feels so math to finally be normal. Not like those two freaks.  What are they doin’ over there? Anyway! I-oh, who’s that?  Oh. Oh my. 
  Stranger, hark! The traps galore may kill you whilst you do explore. To free yourself - |  Huh? Oh. Now where were we? To free yourself from this tomb, and nevermore re-enter, find the room amidst the rooms that lies exactly center?
  Oh! The room is trying to hug us!  Oh no!| Oh, dag.
  Enough of this! | Huh? This room doesn't have any doors. 
   This is wrong. The map lied to me-e. It doesn't want me to find the EXIT! Ice King, h-how do you taste?| Uh, nice, I guess? 
  Mild or SPICY?!| Oh, uh -  Kinda lonely.
  Make yourself into food! Now!| You're going to eat me? Yeah, right.
  Never mind.| Come on, you guys. That mouse showed us the room door.
 Other|  Say, you know what's weird?
  What, Papi?| Well, isn't it weird how Tree Trunks' ability to make pies is specifically what helped us escape from that room?
  I make pies, too, Papi.| Right, yeah, like, battery pies or summin'? 
  No. Real pies. Don't you remember? I am your s- | Hey! Look, another room!
 Other| Good grief, it's humid in here.
  That door will lead us closer to the exit!| Hold up, hold up!  Look! 
 Other| There has to be a way to get across without that thing chompin' our WOO-HOOS!
  Can't you fly us across, Papi?| Oh yeah, I can sure try.
 Other| Nggh! Aw dang, this heat is negating my powers! Can't do nothin' with this steam coming off the water. 
 Other| NGH, glob! Fah!  Nagh! Look at this!  Well, that's it. Show's over. I'll just die here and y'all can eat my body if you want to survive.
  Oh, that's warm on my undercarriage.| H-help me guys!
  Yes, Papi! | NNGH! Lemongrab, c'mon!
  Ugh!| Ew.
  Nugh.. That'll do, Slave Trunks. To the spiraling ledge! | We almost there, Lemongrab?
  The door is secured with an esoteric encryption system.| Well that's okay, 'cause you can hack the mainframe or whatever, right BMO?
  I'm not BMO, I'm your son Neptr. I-I throw pies.|Ohhhs! I grabbed the wrong robot!  Dang! Nuts face!
  Yes, I'm getting a weird feeling in my stomach, and I think it's 'cause of you, Mr. Wizard you'd better fess up to whatever you're doing.  I got no time for nobody dancing around and acting fool at my expense.  I'm Tree Trunks and people know I'm kind and honest, that's why people like me. | Huh? Wha-wha-what's she sayin'?
  So stop sellin' fib-bibs and give it straight! |  Grrrr! All right! I knocked you all out and brought you here!
 Other|  I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Each of you possess the exact qualities to pass the various tests of this dungeon
  Essence.| Yeah...  Shelby, who should've been the bait for the fish.
  Yeah..but no, thanks. | And..BMO, who should've been here instead of this weird piece of junk that I don't remember nothin' about.  Ahhh, I failed!
  Are you happy with me now, Papi?|  Yes! Yes! Oh, my son!  The grand prize of my loins!
 Other| Now you see why I needed to bring you all here. Behold! The Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving!
  What's it do?| Whatever goes in the Magi's flames..comes to life, anything at all!
  Uh, like an ashtray?|  Yes! Isn't it amazing?!
   Uh..You should've told us! I would've freaking brought something!| Do not be sad. Because I brought the ultimate thing!  This.
  Your journal?| Except..it's not my journal!  It's my Fionna &amp; Cake fan-fiction!  All my brilliant fantasies will now be real.  Fionna, Cake, Marshall Lee; they'll all be living, breathing beings, just like me.
   You serve no function, you must be destroyed!  | Yes! Yes! 
  Woo, hahaha, yeah! |  No..NO! Another cruel joke on my life! 
 Other| Oh, good..you're awake, you bum. Look what you did.. Get out of my Face! Yeah, yeah Get out! 
  Don't be sad, Papi. Your characters can always be real in the garden of your mind.|  They can? 
  Remember when you showed me your imagination zone?| Yes! Yes, if I can concentrate... 
 Other|  It worked!
   I missed you, Ice King!| Oh, Fionna, can dreams be real as waking life?
  Of course they can! Dreams are real!| Then I will wait for you, from across the threshold of consciousness.
  Our worlds will surely meet, Ice King.|  I, too, feel this; and it feels so strong it must be true.
  That's not a book! It's a bomb!| You've been acting like a real knucklehead, Doctor Prince. Go on, get out of here! And don't ever do wrong things again!
  You saved the day mega-rad cool guy! What's your name?| Oh, Ice King. I'm such a great guy! This book is yours...
  The Enchiridion! I want to be your best and closest friend.| Let's have a best and closest friend lunch! It's mac'n'cheezles!
  Aww, what a sweetie!|  I'm just so glad you guys are real... you're really, really real! I wanna remember this day forever!
  Hop on, baby!| Weehee hee!
  Ice King, stop, please. This story is terrible!| Hm? Wha—?
  Maybe this story is a new form of torture!| Oh, come on! It's a first draft... don't hate! And besides, that story had everything. Action, adventure, a hotter, older guy... Wildberry, don't pretend; I know you like the silver foxes. 
  What if it were a... little more like real life?| Real? It's based on the real Fionna and Cake!
  Romance is a great idea!| Y'all are just hatin' on my steeze! I'm not listening to haters. Haters!
 Other|What the... Whoa... I'm sorry I didn't think you were real, Gob... but now I've seen your power, and I've got some things that I did that I have to say sorry for.
  Boo.|  Marceline, how long have you been in here?
  Mmm... couple hours. | Oh, so you heard my story, then... Awesome, right?
  Oh hohoho! I loved that one!| Oh, come on! You guys got mad at me for a bad story? I mean it's cute, but... that's not how'd they be! But look, it might not be too late to polish this piece off—let's spitball off some ideas. Like, if Marshall Lee gets sick and dies, but he's got a brother we didn't know about! His name's Marshall Lee...roy. Boom, shocker!  Uh-huh! I feel goosebumps!
  Yeah! It's good!|  Everyone get out...  I know you're out there somewhere... I just haven't figured out how to get to you... but believe me, I will! I will...
  Whaa? Aaaah!| Hey, Princess!
  What now, Ice King?| Remember that time last summer when you said you'd only go out on a date with me if I was the last guy on Ooo?
  47 grapes!|  Anyone having any...  computer problems? 
  How do we stop the computer worm, you pile of goo?!| E-ha-ha-ha-ha! My worm exists beyond your comprehension within the universal source code...
  STOP TALKING LIKE A NERD AND GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT!!!|" Once the glitch does its work, the whole world will be deleted! Except for me and my ""Bubblygums.""  Ow!! Well, see y'all! I'm gonna prepare for my... date. Ahaha! "
  Jake, what is it?| Oh, Princess Bubblegum? Guess who? Can you guess? Can you? I'll give you 3 chances.
  No.| OK, four chances. 
   Ice King, give me the anti-virus, or I'll shoot you with my candy horse tranquilizer!| But sugar, look what I brought you! A box of chocos!  Hm... Still good.  Argh. Look, I can't prove it, but...  ...you made a promise we'd have at least one date if...  ...if I was the last person on Ooo...  You promised... 
  Okay, well, even if I did promised, you're not the last person on Ooo, because I'm still here. | Well, uh... Ooh, I-I have a hand too, y'know? I can lend you one...  Check out my cool hand! 
  Oh, that's disgusting.| Grrrr!!!
   ...No. | Oh, come on, woman, I'm trying to be nice! Can't you at least make the best out of this?  Are you praying to me? I'm into this.  ...I'm still into this.  Still into it.
   GIVE ME THE ANTI-VIRUS!| I can't, monkey peeps, I didn't make one! The glitch will delete everything until we're all that's last!
  You mean, forever?!| Well, yeah! I mean, you say that like it's a bad thing.
  You should wash your mouth! | Huh? No way! Impossible!  Uh...
  Yeah. Where is he? I wanna kick his boingloings, too!| Uh... guys? Hello? Princess. Uh... Let's forget all about this...  Ugh get off of me, you creep! Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!
  Well, great, I'll just put this on ice. |    Someone outside is messing with my ice!  Let's see what's going on down there Gunts.  My on-again-off-again GF Princess Bubblegum —  — my BFs Finn and Jake, all the fine princesses that want to date me! What the heck?! My bro-dogs for life are throwing a party without me?!  Just when you think you got some great bros they kick you to the curb!  Oh, I see how it is, they're gonna do me like that? So I'mma do them like this! 
 Other| Caw! Caw!  That's how the owls do it.  Well, hello, little one. You're going to help me ruin a party!

  Wenk.| Huh, you wanna do that for daddy, huh?
  Wenk! | Thanks, sweetie! I can always count on my Gunts!   Finishing touch.  Yeah, Gunter, hot! You better be careful Gunter or I'll keep you like this all the time! Heh, I just might have to chase you around... Marry you—

 Other| Bargh! There oughta be a law! Wait a minute... there is a law, hee hee, do I have what it takes?
  Banana Guard.| I'm calling to tattle.
  Oh, okay, who are you tattling on?| The loud party going on next door, it's bothering everyone in the Ice Kingdom.
  Ice Kingdom? Is this the Ice King?| Yes.
  Banana Guard.|  Yes, this is a little old lady calling about the loud party.
  Is this the Ice King?|  Noooo, this is Mrs. Garam-bling-ton...
  Mrs. Garamblington?| Yeah, hold on let me get my husband.   Yeah, this is Ted Garamblington, I need you to shut down this party.
  Your wife sounds pretty old.| Uh, hold on there's someone at the door.  Yes, hello?   Hey, Mr. Garamblington, it's me, the pizza delivery boy.  Oh, hi, Johnny.  Boy, that sure is a loud party out there, hope it's not bothering the Mrs.  It's okay Johnny, I'm on the phone with the Banana Guard and they're going to take care of it.
 Other|  Oh, that's good.  Well, what do I owe ya, Johnny?  It's twelve fifty-seven, Mr. G.  Okay, there you go, the prices are going up.  Oh, geez, do you have anything smaller?  Ah, let me check with my brother, George. Hey, George!  What?!  The pizza is here, you got any cash on ya?  I only got a fifty dollar bill!
  Uh, Mr. Garamblington?|  Yes?
  We'll take care of it.| Ha haa!  Now to watch Banana law in action.
  This is a great party.| Two can play the party game!  Ooh, nice. Alright come on Gunthalina, I need you to pass out some whirling dervishes, the guests are getting restless.
 Other|  Loose grape medley, stack of enriched flour tortillas — and start with Roger, he looks famished.

 Other| Bah! Gunter's too captivating!  Um? Oh yeah!  Oh this is my jam! Time to get my freak nasty on!  Roger, dance with me!   Come on! If only there was some way I could magically ruin their party.  Wait a minute  forgetful me!
 Other| I thought you were my bros, my roll dogs for life! 
  Ice King, don't make me stand up and whomp you!| Well, if that's what it takes for a fella to get noticed around here, then whomp me! 
  That's.... IT! | Oh mama, that's some stink!  Aaaah!
  Why are you doing this, IK?!| Because she didn't invite me to her potluck!
  Yes, I did! I sent your invite in the mail!| The mail?! Who reads the mail! I just stack all my mail in a tall pile until it falls over, heh heh, then I shred it to use as cascarones!  So uh, can I party with you?
  Only if you promise to stop acting nanners.| Nanners, well I don't even know the meaning of the word.
 Other| Whoo ooh! Party time, right guys?! Whooo hooo! 
  Ice King, what are you doing in my bedroom?!| Baby, I was trying to surprise you by moving you to my place while you sleep, then have you wake up to breakfast in bed, but now you've ruined the surprise, way to go.
  Do you think I like being kidnapped is that what you think I want!| Okay, here we go, you're the victim right? You know what, since day one I've been doing everything to make this relationship work and for what?!
  Banana Guards! | Babe, come on, we promised we wouldn't make our problems public 
   Take him out. | No, baby! What are you doing?!  Baby bear!  This is just so crazy, if you can honestly look into your heart and tell me you want me to leave, I'll go!
   Okay, leave.|  Uh-what? D-did you look in your heart, like all around it?
   Yes.| I see. Then obviously you have got some heavy emotions stirring in you and you have said some very rash things.  Guards! Take me away! 
  Ice King, get out of Princess-| I'm leaving! 
 Other| Uh, I don't know, did I say the right thing? I can never tell with that girl.   All I can think about... is you, baby girl. I gotta leave Ooo, start somewhere fresh.  Goodbye, Gunter, you're the... man of the house now. 
 Other| Oh, clam balls! 
 Other| Where am I?  Hmm, no signs of life. Just me and these palm fronds,  And that bird over there.  Well, won't be needing this anymore,   I miss her, man.  Hello?  Is someone here?

  Oh, hello there!| Hello.
  Is my singing bothering you?| No.
  ...What?!| No!
  What?| No!!
 ...What?| Ugh, hold on a sec! 
  I asked if my singing was bothering you.|  No, um, not at all, in fact it was quite enchanting.

  Yeah, Party God, do you know him?| Oh eh, sure, I mean, I know of him.
  Oh no, that's him, quick hide! He gets crazy jealous!| Crazy jealous?! 
  |  Ugh, what a wad bag.
  Oh, he's okay... sometimes.|  Gurl, he's no good for you.
   I know.| Ah, who am I kidding. My GF, Princess Bubblegum, treats me like poopies too. The expression on your face when he bounced out on ya, well, I might as well have been lookin' in mirror.
  Neglected lovers party of two! |  Yeah, that's us.
  Well, I like you. You're welcome to stay here as long as you want.| Are you sure?
  Yes, I appreciate your company. |  Yeah, well, PB is just so closed off to her emotions, she crushes the relationship so she doesn't ever have to develop feelings.
  I don't even matter to Party God, he just parties all the time. He doesn't even notice if I'm there or not.| Oh, that's terrible, at least Bubblegum cares if I'm there.
  Sometimes, I wish he would just go into outer space so I'd never have to see him again.| Yeah, he's awful, you shouldn't have to put up with that.
  Yeah, that's true.| Yeah, girl.
  ...I'm gonna break up with him!|  Yeah, girl!
  | Oh, snaps! Good luck! 
  Ugh! You're killing me babe, ouuuuu |  Uh! What was that?!
  Uh...| You should have been like
  I-| Whatever, I'm gonna break up with him for ya'! 
  | Hey, yo! Yo, dog! I need to talk to you.
  Who are you?!| I'm Ice King, we sort of met that time at Peppermint Butler's. Anyway, I've been spending lots of time with your girlfriend, and she re-.
  Whaaaat?!! Hey wait, you're the guy who's been living on her stomach.| Yeah, but no! It was strictly platonic! I wasn't hitting on her or anything.
  There's going to be two hits, bro, me hitting you and a second instance of me hitting you. | Whoa mama!  L-let's talk this out! Think about what's best for her- Ice Lightening!! 
  | Wowzers! 
  Aa yeah, run blue piggy! | Take it easy, wolfy, I just stomped grapes on her tummy, alright! Ahh! Bread balls bread balls bread balls!  Psych!  Eat it, party puppy! 
   Face it bro, my divinity is unassailable. You should have stayed out of my business.|"  She is not your ""bid-ness""! "
"  I can dodge your ""zyaps"" for days "| Uh oh.  Hmmm.
  Whew.| 
  Fun cakes! | I've come to a decision, you ready to hear it? I'm breaking up with ya! You party too much, you never want to spend time with me and you only care about having fun and other people's stereos! I'm just a big island you can come and go from as you please!
  BANANA GUARDS!!| Banana Guard yourself, Princess!!  Ah, we'll work it out.
 I—need—soft—light!  Yeeargh!!| Yeeargh! How long has this been in here? I don't even remember buying this. Oh well—easy come, easy go.  Goodbye! Well, that wasn't so bad.   Hm. 
 Other|" Great news, fellas! I finished all my chores, so we can start movie night early. Take your sits and will reveal the nominees. We got ""Baby Ballet,"" ""Blimby's ""WHO GOTS DA ABC'S"","" ""Airplanes Taking Off,"" —  Oh, wait! What's this one? ""Basic Mortality"
 Other|"OK, all in favor of ""Baby Ballet""—raise your hands."
 Other|"OK, all in favor of Air—What!? ""Baby Ballet""? Come on! Ugh! I should have never given you penguins the right to vote. Well, you may have numbers on your side, but I still have one trick up my sleeve. Bargaining. Whereby, you let me watch ""Basic Mortality,"" and I in return will do anything you want in the whole world. How 'bout it?"
 Wenk.|Algebraic!
 Enough! Alan is not the super-murderer!|I don't know about this show though—
 This, captain, is the most lamentable super-murder I've ever seen—and I've seen plenty.|—might be a touch too dark.
 Guys, hold up! I got the password from the Ice King. Apparently, the barrier only responds to the voice of real wizards. | No way! I'm no rat! I am bound by the sacred trust of esoteric knowledge!
 Say the password, Ice King!|You think I'll just hand you the keys to the city? I'd rather die.
 Say the password.|Ow! My pinky!  Ow.  Thank you.  You know, no one has touched me in months. Could you touch me again?
 Password! Now!!'|"Ow! Ohh! Ohh! ""Wizards Rule!"" THE PASSWORD IS WIZARDS RULE!"" AAH--"
  And then I extract his forehead, right, Bufo?|  Ooh!
  Shush!| Whoa!
 No.| Psst! 
  Wait, I'm coming, too! I'm gonna eat popcorn and make hilarious jokes.  Aw, who ate all my popcorn?| You call this a room? There's not even a window. Oh, wait. Are we rolling?
 Hmm. Maybe...  Ice King, you know anything about cars?|Nope. Not a car guy—too confusing. Got better things to do with my life.
  Just until Gunter finishes rebuilding the Ice Kingdom.|"What y'all whisperin' about?  Hehe! Ex-""squeeze"" me. "
  Ice King, we've told you a thousand times|Sure it is.
 It isn't!|Mm, it's cozy.
  It's not that bad, Jake.|See?
  Finn, can I speak to you in the kitchen?|Oh, hey, Jake, can you bring me a sandwich?  Sandwich?
 It's time to kick Ice King out!! | Don't forget the bread! Haha!
 Checking him to a hotel room.|Oooh! Sandwich time! 
 We'll even put you up for few weeks until your place is ready.|"Ahh, but that sounds lonely. I just like to stay here with you guys! Having roommates is nice! It keeps me out of my head. Gunther says only ""Wenk!"" What's up with that?"
 No. I-I have another idea.|Oop. 
 A sexy wizard like you goes where he wants!| Whoa-oh! I see what's going on!
 What... You do? |Yeah! This wizard donk  is trying to jack my Tree House styles, just 'cause he beat me that one time at Wizard Battle! And if he takes one step closer, I'll bust him up one real good! I never asked to be... 
 I don't know, it's dumb! I'm still working on it! It's-It's nothing!|Oh, you're right that ain't nothing! Check out this wizar!  Whoa!  What?
  Ohh! You're the greatest wizard ever!|Well, maybe not ever ever! Am I the greatest wizard in our generation? Yes.

 Yes, if I ever had to walk, uh, outside at night, I might die of-of...| Of fright.
  Whoa!|See, I told you! Isn't it awesome? Eh, since I'm pretty much in charge here, we can totally take all this treasure if we wanted to.
 Wow! Cool! |Oh, that's just a byncomire.
 Ohh!|Wanna see something really cool?
 Yeah!|Okay, but you gotta promise not to freak out!
 Other|This is Joshua the Dog's Demon Blood Sword.
 |Yeah! It's a real demon blood sword.
 What?!|And you see these words?  If you say them out loud, you can actually see a vision of the demon whose blood was used to make the sword!
 No way! That sounds awesome! Too bad neither of us can read Demon Runes.|Ooh! I know how! Butyrum lac surepo kee oth pradium, like that!
 Other|Oops.
 Bring me the true bearer of my blood sword or I will destroy you both!|Come on, best friend,  let us not betray Finn! Let's fight Kee-Oth ourselves!
 You're wasting your powers on me. Haha!|Oh! No! Oh, no! He's too powerful!

 Stop that now, trash cones! Bella Noche must not cross into our world!|Eh, why not, again?
 You lose, Simon. Sorry, man. |Uh, huh?

 |No!
 Other|Aaah! Go home! You can go! Aah!
 Other|Gunter?
 Other|I don't think this is Gunter.
 It's me, Ice King.|Lumpy Space Princess?
 Yeah.|And you're doing this because you like me?
 No, Ice King, listen. I'm gonna give you the straight dope.|Okay.
 You're weird and old and you kidnap princesses.|I know!
 But I asked you here tonight because I wanna know what you think of this.|" ""The Prince Who Wanted Everything; A Fionna and Cake Adventure""? Hey, why isn't my name on there?"
 I want you to read it because you're their dad. Please be their dad right now and bring them to life!| Okay, might as well...at least until the cops show up. Ahem!
 Other|Once upon a time, there was a most handsome prince, the future king of Lumpy Space, Lumpy Space Prince.
 No!  That's not how I sound! Read it in a better voice!|Okay, Okay! Yeesh! 
 Son, come here at once!|But, all was not perfect for this philanthropic prince of the people.
 Other|His parents were slobbering monsters who didn't care that he was a beautiful prince! They wanted him to be a monster too.
 Hey! You're not supposed to read it like that. Say it in a nicer way!|I...Uh...I don't-
 Yes, your hotness!|And then, Lumpy Space Prince became so real that he can actually break through into this plane of existence. Woah!  And meet his one true love, Lumpy Space Princess. It was really happening. The secret portal began to shake and tremble.

" Uh, name's ""Little Dude."""|Sure, sure.  Hey, uh..
 It's Beau.|Beau bro, right!  Leaf Man bro!  And, uh... Who's this guy?
" I don't know. We just picked him up. That's the kind of trip this is gonna be. It's a ""destiny will guide us"" kind of thing."| How 'bout we call you...Giuseppe.  That's right, Giuseppe.
 Just got one more stop. |Finn and Jake's crib? They won't come. They're out of our league.
 Wooo! |Uh, why'd we stop?
 We don't want to. We'd rather write.|I'll dance if dancing is needed.  Doo-doo doo doo-doo. Yah yah, doo-doo wah  Dance, dance, dancin' dance writing.  I'm dance, dance, dance, dancin'. Top of the bus, window...
 What's all the ruckus?! I own this pasture, so get back in your vehicle and get! |We can't! Our wheels fell off!  Back on the vehicle. I'll make a slick ice road. 
 Are you gone? I can't really see!| Oh! 
 Is there a problem?|I ran out of juice.
 Can I take over?|Yeah, maybe you should. Hey, let's switch headgear.  Ooh, it fits!  Yeah, girl, just let the ice magic flow.  Oh, b-but be careful, okay?
 What? |Oh!  Not me.  Nice ice road.
 Thanks. Hey, I don't think we're moving.|Uh, hold on.  Everyone, time to push the bus!
 Eh, I don't really want to.|Come on! Destiny!  Okay, back on the bus! Back on the bus!  Huh? Ooh, a crabapple tree. Giuseppe, make yourself useful and grab us some of them crabapples.  Okay, get ready. Jump! 
 Oh, no! Giuseppe can't catch up!|What?! Magus of Life Giving, take the wheel! 
 Don't touch me! |"Giuseppe, throw the crabapples!  Giuseppe?  We have lost Giuseppe.  Mm! Hmm? Well, let's see what old Giuseppe wrote.  Listen to this, everybody! ""These are not my tear drops, daughter dear, but just a sheen of dew that lingers here, past other fields where other fathers lie, who kept their daughters better far than I.""  What do you guys think?  What's wrong with you guys?"
 Look who's talking.|" Huh?  This is true art.  Well, let's see what you other guys wrote.  Little Dude, here's yours. ""Days don't have shades, directions with no ways, adjusting minimum scholarly curriculum to enrich empty minds, it takes refracted sunshines."" That is awesome. ""Take this light with your great might, free hearts that are gated seeing truth in things exaggerated."" Ah, some interesting spell combos going on guys."
 Ice King! I see the Butt Rock!|The hour of glory is upon us. Cauldron! 
 Smells so good down here! What's cooking? |
 Girls, we can help.  Okay, one, two, three! Lift! Ow! Ow. Um...let's get out of here. |No, don't go.  Hey, I could freeze all of us. Then we'd be safe from drowning, and once someone discovers our preserved bodies, we'll be saved! Be like, 200 years, tops! 
  Oh, I'm flying!| Yoink. Take my head away from here, baby!  No! 
 Wha?  Hey, it's Giuseppe! | Giuseppe, how have you done this? 
 What was he?|I don't know, Abracadaniel, but I think he was trying to show us something. Something new. 
 Bye, Berdzerd.  See you at the secret thing tonight!  Loser.| Giuseppe.
 Ice King, call it off.|Roger that, Princess. 
  What the? Ice King?| Yeah, I guess there's some cool people here, musics a little loud but the but the punch is top-drawer.
 Mm hmm|Hey, you should come to one of my parties sometime; I'm friends with some pretty cool people too you know?
 Uh huh, who are your friends?|Oh, uh- like that guy, Finn.
  Finn?!|Yeah, Finn and I are pretty tight!
  Oh, hi, are you the ice-dude?| That's me, ice-dude. . Hey, have you ever seen the inside of an ice bear cave?
  Hey, buddy, buddy! Care to freshen me up?! |Yeah, yeah, now scram.
 Hey, is Finn seeing anyone right now? Could you introduce us?  Oh my glob! Is he here now?! |So I guess you're more into the 'little brother-type'? Huh.
  Hey Lauren, I heard your grandpa's given out ice! | Ice?! I'll give you ice!  Oh, looks like I put this party- on ice. Oh wait, you want ice? You, oh, you got iced!  Anyway, oh, don't look at me like that Lauren. . Eh, this party was weak anyway.
  Ow! Mama's milk! Oh, my mama's milk! Oh, that milk! Graybles!|
"  ""I will marry you, Ice King. I will marry you, Ice King. I will marry you—"|  Good morning, madness.  What?! Broken leg again!  and...  Hup!  Hello! How are you?! Oh! Gunther, did you see how this happened?
 Other|I love you, Gunther, but I'm on to your business.
 (wakes up) Wenk!|Gunter? Aw, did baby have a bad dream? Let me get you a bottle.
 Wenk!|Huh? What's heatin' him?
 Hm.|Una— unacceptable. Mm... un-unacceptable. Unaccepta—aah!  Lemons! Whew! Mm.
 Other|Gunter? Y-you having a bad dream? Gunter?
 Other|Oh, my Glob. 
 Hello, Simon.| Oh, lady! Hi.
 Wait, you don't remember me?|Oh, man. I'm so sorry. I stalk a lot of ladies. Were you at Shelby's barbecue?
 Huh. Looks like you've lost it all the way. You've crossed the valley of tears and come out the other side but a shadow.|Oh, thanks.
 Well, all the better for you to...  submit.|I like where this is going.
 Sell your spirit to the skies. Surrender to The Empress eyes.|Empress, my darling! My great eternal love! How can I serve you?
  Bring me blood.|At once! 
 Other|Alley-oop! 
  Oh, this is so sad.|Here you go, my love.
 What's this? Don't you have any human?|Humans? Well, Finn's the only human around here. Try a penguin. 
 Ugh. |You know, Empress is a kind of penguin, and your name is Empress. That's kind of cool, right?
  Bleh. Tastes like cheese water. Where's the top-drawer stuff?|Oh, uh, don't be like that, Honey-poo. I'll fix it. I'll do anything for you.
 Bring me the blood of Finn!|Okay.
 Yeeegh! She doesn't have to know I broke the clock. Let's blame it on the vampires! Or we can hide it! Whoo! Problem solved? Yeah? Whooop!|Snap!
 Aaah! What was that?! Vampiyah! Aah! Aah! Hyah! Hah!|Snap, snap, snapping branches for fun
" Oh, ho, ho, this is riveting. ""The Empress is so nice. Today she let me polish her boots with my tongue. That's almost like kissing, right?"""|Hey! Who's my hunny bunny?!
 What has she done to you? Did she bite you?!|Hey, calm down. You're destroying the mood. I'm trying to get her to bite me later.
 Minion! Honestly, I'm standing right here as you collude against me with my sworn enemy. It's a bit rude.|Sorry.
 Ice King, bind the interlopers in ice.|Heh.
 Other|Let's keep it down, huh? My baby's resting.
 Aaaaaah! No way! Waaaaaaah!|Shush!
 Simon, you have to resist the Empress!|But she's a woman. Aha! Ohh.
 She's a vampire! I hunt vampires because of you!|Because of me?
  Staking vampires, protecting the last remaining humans, it felt like I was protecting you. It was the only thing that brought me happiness during those years.|Oh, Marceline! 
 Simon? A-are you remembering?|Pa-chazz!
 Please, Simon! Remember our history!|Our what now?
 Oh, Marceline. I heard everything. I was invisible. All your tiresome mortal emotions, they'll all be over soon.  Minion, I order you to kill Marceline.|Whaaa?? No way! She's my pal!
 Are you disobeying me?|Hey, it's called real talking.
 Here's our chance!|Please, baby, don't say that.
 You're my thrall.|I am enthralled by you!
 Squeeze!|Yaaaah!
 No!|Heuk!
 You got this comin'.|No!
 Simon, what are you doing?|Let me go! If you want to hurt my lady, you'll have to go through me!
 Now, Oaf! Kill her!|Sweetie, there's no need to raise your voice.
 What?! Okay, that's it. Turn and look at me.|Oh! Are we gonna gaze into each other's eyes again?
 You must fall deeper under my spell. Sell your spirit to the skies.|I can see myself in your pupils. Hee-hee.
 You're not even hypnotized. At all.|Them gigantic sparkly orbs of yours could hypnotize an earclops.
 So, you're not.|Eh-heh, no.
 You're stupid donkey|B-but honey, wh-why you being so mean to me?
 Because you're too thick to even fall under my spell. And you got no class.|Oh, so you're doing that? You're gonna start name-calling? You want to play the blame game?! Okay! Well, if you weren't so perfect and and pretty and statuesque and and
 Better late than never, I guess. |You remembered my song! 
 Simon? W-what are you doing here?|Well, I saw through my peeping scope that everything was going boom and exploding and monsters, and all my friends were in grave danger and horrible torment.
 And you wanted to help?|No! I felt left out. I'm just a phone call away, you know.
  I'm sorry, Simon. Next time, for sure.  Anyway, you don't want in on this fight. This one's a loser.|Oh, I see. Sittin' this one out, huh?
 Yeah, I guess. And don't try to talk me out of it.|What? No, no, I'm right there with you. You and me—we're survivors, right? Like cockroaches or rats. Sure, you could fight and try to save the day, but what if you lose? Then what? You could die. Better to rot and hide like a rat, right, buddy? 
 Ugh!  Did you just call me a cockroach, Simon?!|What? No! No, no, no, no.
 Thanks, buddy.|Yes.
 Or we could get a real good night's sleep and start fresh and early in the morning. Wenk, wenk.|All right! Where is he?!
 Man, Ice King, you better roll on.|Where are you hiding him?!
 Who are you talking about?|It's Gunter! He's gone missing!
 Other|You in there, Goontz?
 Come on, man, not the food.|Daddy's here to save you, Goonty!
 What makes you think we took him?|'Cause it's obvious You took Gunter, because Gunter is like your Jake.
 Wait, what?|Or maybe Gunter's like your Finn. The point is, you guys have always resented us for that fact, and that right there constitutes motive And conspiracy to harm my little road dog, Gunter!
 All right, all right, all right. Wenk, wenk.|Aww, look at the little guy.
 You want to try telling us what happened?|Okay, so, we were watching some young men's junior figure skating championships on the tube semi-finals. I went to the kitchen to fix us up something to eat. When I came back, he was gone.
 Simon! What's this?|It's a present. To bribe you for coming over.
 You don't have to bribe us, silly. We're here because we want to hang out with you.|"No one has ever said that to me before. You didn't say, ""No take backs."""
 Bottoms down.|So, check it out! I upgraded my home karaoke system. Do you like karaoke?
 Marceline?|Irslerskat prjon! Prjon, prjon Prrrrrrrrrrrrjon!
 No! Simon!|Hi, Marceline.
 Cool out, B-Bell. I know you love karaoke, but you can't take it so seriously.|I hope you like penguin cuisine. It's mostly just shapes.
 Here, Simon. I know these are your favos.|Thanks, Gunther!
 There's some wrong with Wait. You just called him Simon.|Call me whatever you want. This is the best date I've been on since my last date.
 This is not a date.|Neither was the last one. It was a robbery.
 For real?|Yeah. She stole my heart. And my crown.
 I don't see anything. These are just weird dots to me.|My place is trashed and I can't remember a thing. Great dinner party, huh?
 It's probably nothing. He's been good lately, but it's a big speech, you know.| Ohh. Ah.
 Hey Ice King!|Aah! I'm not doing anything wrong. I was just lady-watching.  Ow!
 Yay, sea lard!| Wow, what an adventure.
  And there was even a purple lady kind of like you, Ice King! She even sounded just like you.|She sounds magnificent! How'd you say you got there?
 We didn't. Beat it, creep.|I'll figure it out.
 But Simon, if you go there, you'll lose you memories.|What memories? I'm like a goldfish over here.
  In what way, exactly?|Oh, hey Jake.  Where am I?
 It's over, Ice King!|Oh, hi, guys.
 Yeah, man, you have, like, one muumuu, and you're wearing it.|You think this is about hangers? Really?
 You're stealing everyone's hangers, dude.|It's about so much more! Come back to my place, and I'll explain everything.
 Hmm.|See? I dropped my keys down this deep hole. I need all these hanger guys to help me snag 'em. When I'm done, I'll return them all, and that's an ice promise.
 How long has this crack been here?|Forever. Before forever. What the...  Oh! Something's got me!
 Let go of the hanger!|Huh?
 Let go!|Oh.
 This calls for an investigation.|All right. Stand back!  Follow me, fellas!
 Other|Watch your heads.
 Other|Holy moly! Do you know what this extra square footage means when I decide to sell?
 I don't know.|Well, no rest for the sexy.
 That's not the expression.|Boy, this is strong. A lot stronger than my ice. 
 Oh, boy, here we go.|Back off, son! I saw her first!
 Who's a good boy?|Ahem. They call me the Ice King. I also make ice. 
  Hup! Well, I think you're pretty groovy. Do you wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna be my acolyte?|Sure. What's that? Like a boyfriend?
 More like an intern.|Oh.
 Uh, no, you're right. It is more like a boyfriend.|Cool.
 YOU'RE COOL! Dialed in, you know?| Huh, what?
 I'm starting to get a weird feeling.|Oh, you must mean Slime Princess, Princess Bubblegum, and Flame Princess.
 Princesses?|We're like this!
 That is so fun. Okay now, this next request may sound super sketch.|Okay.
 I need you to round them up and bring them back here. Like, even if they don't want to come. You think you could do that?|Are you kidding? That's in my wheelhouse, right up my alley! Classic Ice King.
 So, wait, is it in your wheelhouse or up your alley?|Classic Ice King.
 Okay Jake---|Wow, you got their initials on there, and look at those shapes. We're kind of like a power couple.
 Get me those princesses.|You got it, boss.
 Wenk!|Great critique! 
 Wenk.|I don't need an editor. I'm my own editor -- editor-in-king!
 Other|"Ooh! My custom tape! Remix!  ""Sunlight gleamed through the window as Fionna sat patiently at the breakfast table."" "
  No one asked you, Flour Demon.|"That was like a cookbook... written by a genius. On to the next chapter -- ""A Game of Gumball."""
 I really did like her story, though. I wonder how that Ice President got elected.|Talk about life imitating art. Gunter, did you see what Daddy did? Did you guess the secret theme?
 Wenk!|No! You're way off! Fionna and Cake were at the breakfast table. Gumball consulted the periodic table. Flame Prince set fire to the table of contents. The...purple thing had a tablespoon of syrup. And Ice Queen...did a tabley thing, too, probably.
 Wenk!|They're not like regular stories. They're shorter. I'll call them...grabl-- No -- tables!
 I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!|Skyhooks!
 Looks like we got away before the candy curse became permanent.|That’s right. My skyhooks saved the day.
 Thanks for getting us out of there, Simon.|Aw, I can’t take all the credit. It’s all thanks to my skyhooks!
 Hey, why are you even up here?|We live here, now. Me and the skyhooks.
 ...butt.|Skyhooks!
 Other|" I said ""the end""!"
  Where do your ideas come from?|They're beamed into my melon at night - same as everybody else. Next!
 I have more of a criticism than a question.| I am very open to criticism!
 Your story was completely wrong.| And how would you know?
 Dude, I literally have one bazillion questions.  Uh, excuse me, Miss Fionna... Where did this video come fr-o-o-m!|Fionna! I always knew we'd meet one day and become best friends. So, uh, remember that time when Cake caught Ruse Goose, the notorious goose pickpocket?
 That was such a long time ago.|But during trial, you realized she was framed 'cause it was actually Abracadanielle pretending to be a goose all along!
 Can I also ask a question?|Besties only.
 I was just gonna ask if we could see more of the tape.|Oh, yeah, can we?
 Aw!|I want to see more.
 Library closes in five.  Click, click, click.|So, where you heading now?
 Guess I'll go back to the dump under the bridge where I live. I'd invite you over, but I don't have a sofa or TV or anything. It's literally a dump.|I have a TV. My crib is equipped.
 Oh, really?|Hey, you should move in! Please live with me, Fionna.
 Other|This is the sweet spot. My roo--  Oh! I wasn't expecting guests.  Not that you mind a bit of dirt, right?
 Other|Nice, huh?
 So, this is my room now.|Only the best for Fionna.
 Other|Oh yeah, I like this room too. It's where I do all my deep thinking. Man, I still can't believe it-- the Fionna in my bathroom, touching my toothbrush, throwing it into my little trash can. Fionna taking charge!
 That's what heroes do.|You're a so much better hero than Finn.
 I know.|Plus, don't tell Jake, but I've always been more of a cat person. Where is Cake the Cat?  Cake? Cake?
 Cake is gone. Some years back, there was an adventure mishap. I don't feel comfortable talking about it.|Oh, okay.
 Hey, you still haven't shown me where you keep your Fionna and Cake tapes.|Sorry, no can do.
 What? Don't you have tapes?|Oh, yeah, I got loads of tapes, but they're super private.
 Maybe you'll change your mind once you see more of my mummy adventure?|Yay! I'll get snacks.
 Okay, that's the end of the tape.|Really? My stories usually get wrapped up neater.  Wrapped up -- mummies.
 Yeah, well, there's no more, so...  You wouldn't know this, but old heroes need a lot of sleep.|I did know that.
 See you in the morning.| Okay.
 Other| Fionna? You awake? I made you a midnight snack.
  Mummy, we're home.| I knew it.
 That's right. I snuck in here to pretend to steal your stash and teach you a valuable lesson. Never invite strangers into your home, no matter how cool they seem and are. You should be thanking me really.|Of course. She didn't want me to see the end of the tape because she's not Fionna. She's... a mummy!  Aah!
 Come on. They're all just him?|Imposter! Reveal yourself! 
 Aah! Knock it off!|You're the knock-off!
 What?|You're not Fionna!
 How did you--|Show me your true form!
 Other|Aha! Huh? What kind of mummy are you supposed to be?
 No kind! I'm just an old lady.|Who likes to dress up as Fionna?
 It makes me feel confident, okay? Plus I look really good in this outfit.  Look, I used to be very shy, tinkering with my tech stuff all night, sleeping all day. But one evening, I intercepted a strange signal. I was mesmerized. I watched that tape like a hundred times before I finally stepped out of my cave a new woman, determined to find more Fionna and Cake. I roamed Ooo for years with no luck. But then I found out about you, and I hatched a plan to steal your tapes.|What? I don't have any Fionna and Cake tapes.
 I know! All of your tapes are filled with embarrassing diaries.|If I met them, I'd definitely record it.
 Fionna and Cake aren't real, you ding-dong! They're just, like, a TV show from the past or something.|You're the ding-dong, lady! You tricked an old, defenseless Ice King. 
 Look, I didn't mean to hurt you.|You lied to me. Fionna would never lie -- never.
 Wenk.|Huh? Well, that was disheartening.
  Aww.|Boy, this is great, huh? You and me out in the fresh air? Now, the key to being a tip-top salesman is to get the ol' foot in the door.
 Bodies don't talk, Ice King.|Well, mine does.
" Okay, then. If I say ""My feet hurt,"" you can go ""Woof woof."" That's my dogs barking."|BMO, I think we're gonna make an unbeatable team.
  I can't believe we unloaded that branch. It wasn't even our best one. Oh, my. Shield my eyes from the sun.|Why?
 How are your children?! Ice King, duck. Jump. Right. Right again.  Left. Jump, jump. Left. Right. Left. Ice King, you're doing so good. You have not bumped into anything.|BMO, where's the customer?
 Look. A house.|All I see is the inside of this coat.
  Oh, excuse my indigestion. |Ouch.
 That's a BMO guarantee.| Psst! Does Finn know you have his teeth? Because I don't think-
 They're made out of some kind of hard tooth-like material. Ouch. Ouch! Ice King, freeze these nightmare babies.|I'm not allowed to wear my crown. It's against BMO's dress code.
 Hmm. Maybe I sold too well.|Hey, you're a great salesman. Evil babies are not a problem for you. They're an opportunity.
 I'm sorry I caused such a mess. It's very bad for business.|Well, time to call it a day.  The ice man leaveth.
 Hey, wait. See you tomorrow, partner. |Until tomorrow.
  Yeah, I didn't draw that, but cool. Well, thanks for-|"Oh, yeah. But, uh, what if - and I'm just spitballin'. What if it was something more like, ""Hey, Doc! I got a caveman in my teeth!"" Huh?"
 Other|Haha! Whoo!
 Heh. Yeah. That's pretty good, I guess.|Oh, is this Ble? I love Ble! That one with the two cops who are always accidentally arresting each other.
" Right?! And ""Animal Quackers""!"|I've been mailing them my short stories and comics for as long as I can remember. But, uh, nary a piece published. Nary a piece.  Nary a piece! I hate Ble! Sittin' in their ivory towers! They don't know comedy! They don't understand the common folk! The busy woman on the go!
  The average Joe or Josephine! Right!|See? We got the goods, you and I, and they've lost their touch. Hey, if we want them to touch our goods, we should go down there and confront them face-to-face.
 And if I get my winning caption printed, everybody will know it's funny! I'm talking about you, BMO. But, uh, where do they print Ble?|Oh, yeah. I don't, uh... Oh! Oh! Yeah, hold this. I'll use my... demonic wishing eye!
 Hello, Ice King.|Hello, Wishy!
 What do you like to wish for?|I wish to go to Ble!
 Whoa. Why don't you just use that thing all the time?|Oh, it takes a piece of your soul each time you use it. But look! The legendary Bledquarters!
 Okay, what's our plan here?|Maybe if we eat all this ammo, he'll be forced to make more for us.
 You win. Fine. I've never let anyone inside before, so I hope you have an amazing pitch.|Hey! These are all my submissions! They kept them in a big pile by the door... Seems like a good sign!
 This means that Ble Magazine is dead, too!  Now how am I supposed to prove my caption's funny.|Ding dong! I found Ble 217! We can see what the winning caption was.
"  ""I'm going to write you a prescription for one giant club."" "|It's about time us young guns took the reins.
 Other|Hello, boys. Now let's roll these presses one last time.
 Our very own Ble Magazine.|"And it's a pretty good issue, too. We got that nice cover you did, my short story, ""Fionna and Cake"
 Big Tina wrote those!|"...""Fionna and Cake"
 Maybe it doesn't matter if my caption is funny or not. I think I just wanted to be part of Ble. It's something I've been a fan of for so long. And maybe we can bring it back. There's no reason it can't have a new dawn. A Blennaissance!|Okay, boys, close her down!
 It wasn't me!| It's been real cool being in this rogue's gallery with you. Me and Gunter were gonna go, uh...  Oh... my...  GOLB!
 Have you thought about using sliced almonds for the sundaes? | ...I don't know who that is!
 Ice King! Ice King!|What's up?
 You are the only one who can stop this! Betty's up there, trying to harness the power of GOLB! We have to snap her out of that trance and banish GOLB, or we're all doomed! If anyone can do it, it's you.|Sounds great! Im'a save the world! 
 Ugh! |Evil penguins!
 Go ahead. Talk to her, IK.|Who?  Oh, it's weird lady! Hey, lady. ...I'm diggin' your primitive dance style!
 No! You're supposed to stop her, not encourage her! You gotta dig deep inside and find those magical words to shake her outta that trance! Get personal and emotional!|Personal? Emotional? Oh! Just like a fan-fic!
 No!...|"""I feel like nothing was real until I met you. I feel like we connect. And I really get you. If I said 'You're a beautiful girl,  would it upset you? The way you look tonight, silhouetted, I'll never forget it."""
