 Pick up that platter, tough guy.|Old Mr. Cream Puff?
  We used to date. |Something's happening! Come on, come on...
 Work.|Algebraic!
 Ew!|Hey, look, the decorpsinator serum is working!
  Rah. Must eat sugar!| You're grounded, Mister.
 Oh, this is really bad. They're going to be attracted to the Candy Kingdom!|Why?
  Gimme some sugar, baby.|Chew on this! 
  Good one, Finn. Quickly, to the kingdom!| Get a life!
  Hurry, sweet citizens.|Alright, you heard the princess, everyone in! Alright, no pushing, come on!
 Dude, what's up?|The princess will explain everything. Tree Trunks, get those hot buns in here, girl.
  Oh, I hope it's not bad news.|Did we get everyone?
 All present and accounted for.|Thanks, Manfried.
 Citizens, we are assembled here in the candy foyer for a momentous announcement. Tonight we are all going to have... a slumber party!|What?!
 What?!|Wait! What about the zom--?! 
 Go ahead and start partying.| But, Princess, the Undead--
 Finn, the Candy People can't know about the zombies.|Wha?!
 If they knew, they would flip out.|"What do you mean ""flip out""?"
 Princess? It's me, Starchie the gravedigger. I brought you a larger corpse shovel. Oh, Princess? Well, I'll just wait for you here, then. By the mausoleum. With my back turned. And my defenses lowered.|Candy People explode when they get scared?!
 Not telling the Candy People about the zombies is so important that you need to promise, Royal Promise, not to let anyone find out about the zombies, ever.|Okay, sure.
 No, Finn. You have to Royal Promise.|Yes,  I Royal Promise.
 Now I must cloister myself in the lab and finish the equation to my decorpsinator serum. You keep the candy folk distracted and ignorant. Can you do that?|Yes, your highness.
 Good. Don't tell anyone about the zombies. Never ever. |No, wait. Can I at least tell  Jake?
 Tell me about what, dude?|You know, about the outbreak of zom-- 
  Alright, what's going on?|Uhh, nothing at all, buddy! 
 Hey, dude. I think you and Bubblegum are up to something.| Ahha ah, what? No, no way.
 Whoa, you guys are up to something. Is it some sort of prank? Can I get in on it?|" Who wants to play ""Truth or Dare""?"
 Hmm...|Ok, Chocoberry, you may ask someone to tell a deep truth or a saucy dare.
  Hey seriously, man. I'm your bro. Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time. What are you and Bubblegum up to? Is everything alright?|Yep! Fine! Everything is great! Heh, heh.  Except for that. Whoa.
 I can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause I'm a dog and they'd probably kill me, but hmmmmm probably... neither. Finn! Truth or dare?|Dare! Haha!
 I dare you... to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind. What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together?| Umm, ahh, the truth is, ahhh...
 You promised you wouldn't freakin' tell anyone! Oh, you're so cute, Finn.|Ahhh... the truth is... that I'd rather play Dodge Socks!
 I'm not playing dodge socks 'til you stop dodging my questions. Hey...  Old Mr. Cream Puff? Isn't he dead?|Hey, give me my sock back! Dodge Socks was a bad idea!
 Whoa.  Look dude, just tell me what's up, 'cause you are crazier than a cannonball tonight.| Oh, my goodness! Princess hasn't finished the equation and the zombies are here!
  Oh, my goodness! Princess hasn't finished the equation and the zombies are here!|I, uh, she just want this slumber party to be super fun, and if I did have something to tell you, then I would in a second, and it would make my life easier, unless there was something stopping me, like a promise, but there isn't, so I won't, so it's cool.
 What? You lost me.|Umm... Hey, you know what time it is?
 Adventure time?|No, time for Seven Minutes in Heaven! You're first.
 Really?|Lady Rainicorn! In the closet with Jake!
 Okay, okay, alright.  But in seven minutes, I'm gonna come out and make you spill your beans, Finn.|I can't hear you all the way in heaven!
 Umm, does anyone else hear that?|What? Hear what? I, I don't hear anything.
 I hear something I don't understand... and it makes me scared! |What? No, Chet. Everybody, wait. What noise? You mean this noise? 
 Oh. |Yeah! Dance it! Bust it up! Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh!
 What is this game you are playing at now, Finn?|Uhh, it's... Blockado. Haha, the game of barricades. Come on, let's block all the entrances and windows!
 Uhh, it's... Blockado. Haha, the game of barricades. Come on, let's block all the entrances and windows!|Alright, this is not a permanent solution. Think Finn, how can you keep everyone from finding out?
 Find out about what, Finn?|Manfried, the talking piñata! Your convenient appearance gives me a great idea. Everyone, grab a stick! New game! We're gonna smash some piñatas!
 What?|Except for you, Manfried.
 Oh, thank goodness.|Now everybody don these blindfolds.  Thanks, Taffy Girl.
 Now everybody don these blindfolds.  Thanks, Taffy Girl.|Alright, everybody, get together. I'm hanging the piñatas...  They're all around you. Smash the piñatas!
 Alright, everybody, get together. I'm hanging the piñatas...  They're all around you. Smash the piñatas!|Yeah! You guys are on fire!
 Oh, it is so tasty.|Yes! We did it! My improbable plan worked!
 Seven minutes up yet?  Whoa!  What the nuts happened here?!|Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess Bubblegum and I raised from the dead.
 Really!?|Jake? What's going on?
 What? Huh? Oh, Finn! Did you break your Royal Promise?|Yeah, but, I mean, all the zombies are dead. The Candy People won't freak out. What's the big deal?
 Finn the Human. You have broken a Royal Promise for which the penalty is trial by fire.|That's stupid.
 ...Math questions!|Mathematical!
 Finn, you're terrible at math.|Awww.
 Now, solve this! |Uhh....
 Yes! Two plus two. Solve it or die.|Uhh. Four, right?
 Oh, correct.|What's happening, Princess?
 You've defeated the broken royal promise! The Gumball Guardians are resetting!|"Slamacow! That was tops! Who's not good at math? I was all ""Four!"""
 Four, four... Four, four, four... That's it! The answer was so simple, I was too smart to see it!|You're welcome!
 Golly!|Woohoo! Yeah!
 I hope you grasp the full consequences of breaking promises.|Heck yeah! If I break a Royal Promise, I get to fight zombies, throw slumber parties, awake Gumball Guardians and... and...
 Alright, alright.| And reverse death itself!
 Oh, you are adorable. But keep your promises, okay?|I will, Princess.
 I will, Princess.|Starchie, you're not a zombie.
 I can't help it. Flesh is delicious!|You're delicious!
  Bouncing!| Princess, this tea party sucks in a big way! But thanks for the invite!
  Oh, don't worry, Finn. The Mallow Tea Ceremony takes years to master.| Princess! I think I just now mastered it!  One more bounce.  Alright!  Unh! Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake?
  What?! No way! It's super easy!| Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker! You're floating, not bouncing!
  Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry.| Dude! Your leg!
  Nah, that's no bump. It's the early stage of the lumps.| Is it serious?
  It just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite. It's just like, um, y'know... werewolf rules?  Ar, rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!| Oh, no!
  What? You think I'm gonna turn all lumpy like her? Get outta here.  Wha? Finn, I think I'm freakin' out!| Calm down, bud! I'll... I'll sock the lumpiness outta ya!
  He'll be lumpy, like, forever.| LSP, please! Can you tell us how to reach Lumpy Space?
  Don't go telling everyone about this portal or whatever. It's kind of a secret.| Where is it?
  Good day, Princess. Is your father okay with you entering Lumpy Space with two...  non-Lumpers?|  Just say yes! Yes, yes, yes!
  It's up there at Makeout Point.| That's so close! We can run there in no...  ...time. Aww, what?!! It's, like, a million-mile fall into space!
"  I SAID, ""LUMP OFF,"" MOM!!! "| Uh...
   WHAT?!?!| Vroom vroom??
  Shucks! I lumping hate them! I'm really, really sorry, Finn. But I can't help you because my parents are horrible idiots.| Don't you know anyone else with a car?
  My friend Melissa has a car. But she's dating my ex-boyfriend Brad.|  Call her NOW.
  Hey, Melissa. What's up?| What's she saying?
  Oh, Glob. I forgot.| What'd she say?
  Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!  It's gonna be so flipping awesome!|  LSP, we don't have time for this. Ask for the ride, LSP.
  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh—  Wha?!|  Melissa,  you should totally drive us to Makeout Point to make out with hot boys!
  LSP, you're so baaaaad... be there in a sec!| Biyah. 
  Hmm. |  Sorry. But Jake's lumpiness is worsening!
  Hi!| Ugh... OKAY! Let's go, let's go, let's go!!
  Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right?  Ah. I love this song. We should totally TP Shandala's house!  Gracious! That was terrible! Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps... if I do turn... if I become lumpy like them, I want you to—|  It's not gonna come to that. But if it does, I'll bury you beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree!
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy, then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake. What did you think I was sayin'?| Oh, um...  Heh heh.  CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!
  We've been here for, like, five minutes.| Finally! Huh? This doesn't look like Makeout Point.
  This is Brad's house. You wanted a ride to Makeout Point? You think I want to make out with you?!| Uh...
   Well, maybe I do, but... wait.  I HAVE A BOYFRIEND, FINN!! | LSP, we gotta hurry! Jake's running out of time!
  This is it.| Let's go!
  Wait. Watch yourself, Finn. The guys who use the antidote up here are notorious for being...  smooth posers.| What does that mean?
  It just means what it means. Hurry. Get the antidote so we can get outta here.| Thanks, LSP.
  Um... bumps.| Uh, yeah, bumps.
  Aw, man!| Hey, guys. Lookin' smooth!
  Really? You think we're smooth?| Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah!
  Why are you sucking up to us?| My best friend needs an antidote for lumpiness.
  Chyah, lumpiness suuucks. Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere-hog!  My turn! | So the antidote is in that orb you were sitting on!
  This orb is the antidote, bruh.| Can my friend borrow it?
  Yeah, sure, as long as you give it right back. | Hammacow. Thanks, fellas.
  What's taking so long? Did those smooth-heads give you the orb already, or what?| Wait!!
  Sorry, kid.  We changed our minds.| Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?!
  What? I was helping you.|  Thanks a lot!  They were right about to hand over the antidote!
   You're welcome a lot.| You insulted them! And they got mad! And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!
  No. Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me!  Oh, yah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy. | JAKE! IT'S ALMOST SUNSET!!  Jake... I didn't save him... I...  I'LL KILL YOU, LUMPY SPAAAAAACE!!
  Jam on, man!| Huh? I thought you guys left!
  We were drawn back by your plaintive wail. We dig your directionless fury.| Um, thanks.
  Respect. Here.  Take it. Win your girl back!| Yeah, there's no girl. But there is still time to save Jake! Do you guys know where Promcoming is?
  Promcoming takes place way down on that land-lump.| Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels?
  Nah. We were all ditched here just like you.| Well... you think I can make it to that land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?
  You kidding?! A smoothie like you will plummet right into the eternal void!| What if I was lumpy? Could I float over?
  I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of you making it!| That's good enough for me. Now bite me!!
  That's good enough for me. Now bite me!!|  Yes! I can feel the multiple bites accelerating the lumpification process! I'm starting to float!
  Don't jump, guy!!| I have to! For my buddy.  RAAAAAAGH!!!!
  Wow. He's insane.| Ah, I made it! And there he is!
  Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool!| Jake! I'm mostly lumpy now! And I totally think you should sit on this sphere!
  No!| Sit on it!
   No!!| Please, Jake! You're my best friend! Just sit on the sphere!
  Chyah! I remember you! You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser!| Sit on it!! Before I turn completely lumpy!!
  NO!!| Oh, no! I can feel the lumpiness... about to consume me!!  Oh, yah. Being lumpy's the best.
  Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy. Take your ball and get outta here.| Fine. I don't want you to have it anyway.
  So I can't have it now, eh?| That's right. It's mine.
  GIMME THAT BALL!!| NO! You can't have it!
  I want it! Give it to me!| You want it that bad? Go get it, then!
  Bumps, bi—   Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore! Oh, no. Finn buddy! You gotta sit on this!| No! You can't make me! Smooth—OOF! 
  Finn! Hey, Finn! Hey, buddy! Finn|  Huh?
  Hey, dude. We made it.| Man... There's something cold under my butt.  Oh!  The antidote! Just in time, too! LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before. I didn't mean it. I was just really stressed out.
  You know, it's fine. You and Jake can make it up to me by dancing this last dance with me.| Sounds good to me. Whaddaya say, Jake?
  Oh, no, our sled's broken! Hey, let's build one out of snow! | What are you doing, Jake?
  Sleds are for suckers. Just ride on my gut.| Okay! 
  Switch!|  Switch back! Switch back! 
   Switch back! Switch back! | Penguins!
  Penguins!| Ha Ha!
 Other| Aww, Ice King's here.
"  Yeah, I know what ""Ice King"" means"| Oh ho oh! Holy cow!
  Come on, brother! We're just trying to beat the heat.| Yeah! There's a big sleeping lava man in our front yard, and he is SOOOOOOOOOOOO hot!
  Mmm-hmm!|" Wait, wait, no, I take it back. I mean, not like ""sexy"" hot."
"  No, no, you do mean ""sexy"" hot."| No, I mean--
 Other|  Why don't you just try being cool.
  Uh oh.| 
 Other| Heh heh, yeah.
  Finn! Are you okay?| Huh, Wildberry Princess? Hot Dog Princess? W-what's goin' on?
  We're all prisoners, Finn.| Ice King!
 Other| Why are you keeping these girls prisoners, jerk?
 Other| Ice King, don't do this. Just let the girls go. They don't want to be here.
  Mm-hm.|  Don't worry, princesses. I pledge that Jake and I will protect each and everyone of you and furthermore I see all of you happily married to whatever sweet thing y'all want to be married to!
 Other|Rad! All I need is something to spear the Ice King with.  Binoculars... toothbrush...water bottle...rope...  sweater... trail mix... my flute! 
 Rad! All I need is something to spear the Ice King with.  Binoculars... toothbrush...water bottle...rope...  sweater... trail mix... my flute! | My flute!
  Aw, nuts, dude! You broke it when we tried picking the lock to that sad ogre's heart!| Darn it!
 Other| Jake!
   I... I'm okay.| Ice King! You better either set us free or come in here and fight me 'cause otherwise I'm gonna flip out!!!
 Other| ICE KING!!!...
  Finn!| Huh? Jake, you alright?
  I'm fine, buddy. Calm down and tend to the princesses.| Oh my gosh. I'm sorry, princesses. Slime Princess, are you alright?
  He's held us here for weeks, questioning us about our favorite sports and quirky behavior. I've tried to tell him as little as possible.| I understand. And, Lumpy Space Princess, how do you fair?
 Other| Leave her alone, Ice King!
  What are you thinking, Finn?| I've almost devised a plan. I'm gonna let him drum till' I've finalized the details in my mind.
 Other| Ah! It was fun! Hey, you should get some more fun stuff.
 Other|" ""Good idea,"" indeed."
 Other|" Alright. I've got a plan on how to get out of here. First everyone needs to be dancing and laughing and saying fun stuff like ""Whoopee""! Okay, when the Ice King comes back, everyone play it up, like we want him to come inside the jail and party with us and when he steps inside, I'm gonna beat the tar out of him with these...  ...while you all take care of Jake. Everyone on board with this?"
"  I think by everyone saying ""whoopee"" the plan won't work cause he'll know we're faking it."| Good point, Lumpy Space Princess.
 Other| We're having fun! Whoopee!
 Other|  He's not buying it. Dance harder.
  Come on in here and party.| Wanna dance with us, Ice King? Come on!
 Other| No! That is not the case! You're nuts, man! And I don't know how to help you! Probably because I'm just a simple dude. So maybe you should talk to someone with more life experience, like Jake!
  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Finn, what are you doing? Don't dump the Ice King on me!| But you gotta get it in you're head, man! Putting princesses in jail is wrong!
  Thank you, Finn.|  You're welcome, Slime Princess!
  And remember when you vowed to marry us to the thing of our choosing?| Yeah...
  Ooooh!|  Oh, heh heh, well how 'bout that... Jake, help me!
  Oh, gross! Put me down! Put me down!!!| Heh heh, I'm sorry. Jake! 
  Now, come on over! I baked y'all an apple pie.| Yeah, apple pie!
  Whooo-hoo-hoo!| I'm gonna eat it all before you even GET there! 
  Noooooo!| Apple pie!
  Shoo, fly! Get off my apple pie! Huh!  A fly landed on my pie. That's no good.  Bye-bye.| Why are you throwing the pie away?
  New pie?| Woohoo! Pie, yeah!
  Here you are.| Wow.
  Oh, Jake, thank you, but that ain't the best apple pie.| What are you talking about, Tree Trunks? What can be better than your apple pie?
  Finn, what would you do if you could do anything?| Anything? Well, I'd catch a shooting star, travel to outer space and fight space monsters!
  I'd carve my face on the moon so the moon would look like my face!| What would you do, Tree Trunks?
  I would go pick an apple.| ...Lame.
  ...Lame.| I'm sorry. I mean, it's just you pick apples every day.
  That sounds awesome!| Where is it?
  I've heard that it grows at the deepest end of the Evil Dark Forest.| Whoo! Tree Trunks you gotta go pick that apple!
  What? Me? Oh, no I'm just a cute little elephant. I'm not cut out for adventuring.| Tree Trunks! This is your dream! Think about eating that apple with your own mouth.
  Or your trunk.| Imagine the flavor.
  Really? You think I can handle the Scary Dark Forest?| Yeah, and we'll help you.
  Psst, I can take you even higher on my shoulders.| No, Jake. She has a weak heart.
  Oh, yeah.| Ewww, why is this ground all squishy?
  I wanna try!| Okay. I'm cool with you letting you do whatever you want.
  Oh, hello there.| Uhh, Tree Trunks, stay away from that.
  Uhh, Tree Trunks, stay away from that.| Ugh, you're gonna get it, wall of flesh.
  An eye and a mouth. Well, I think I got the perfect thing for him or her... stickers!| Careful, Tree Trunks, this thing is evil.
  Oh, now, whatcha doing?| Huh? Tree Trunks!
  Whoo!| You better stay in that tree, baby. Um, Tree Trunks were you putting stickers on that evil monster?
  Yes, I thought it needed some tender love and affection. Oh, what a pretty butterfly!| Tree Trunks? Ugh. Jake, I just realized that Tree Trunks is old and bonkers. We can't take her through this Evil Dark Forest.
  Nah, she'll be fine.| But the monsters?
  It's fine. It's fine!| Are you sure? 'Cause she has zero adventurer training.
  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine, she'll be fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.|  Maybe it is fine. Tree Trunks?
  Where'd she go?| Tree Trunks!
  Tree Trunks!| We gotta find her, Jake! Tree Trunks!
  And here's your sandwich. Oops, you dropped it.| Tree Trunks, run!
  Hiya!| Time to call your mamas, evil sign posts.
  Patience, boys. There's enough tea for everyone.| Errr...
  Oh, Finn. What a nice hug.| I'm not hugging you! I'm trying to save your life! There's too many!!
  Oh, Finn. That tea party was crummier than a big old biscuit.| Errrr. Tree Trunks, I'm all jacked up because of you. Look at my jacked up face!
  Are you mad at me?| No, I'm not mad. You're too super-cute for me to be mad at you, and you're a top notch adventurer. Now, let's go find and eat the heck out of that crystal gem apple together.
  No, I'm not mad. You're too super-cute for me to be mad at you, and you're a top notch adventurer. Now, let's go find and eat the heck out of that crystal gem apple together.| Dang it!
  You go fight—I'll keep Tree Trunks out of trouble.| Awesome.
  I'm helping you by tempting this guy with my body.| It's not a guy, Tree Trunks! It's a Snake Armed Ruby Brain Beast!
  Even brain beasts get lonely, Finn!| Jake! You were supposed to watch her!
  She got passed me, man. I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me.| GET her out of here!
  Finn, kill it!| I can't find it's magic gem weak spot!
  I can't find it's magic gem weak spot!| Oh, there it is.
  I did it! I helped! I'm the sexiest adventurer in the world!| Tree Trunks!! You're not an adventurer! You nearly got yourself killed again! Do you wanna die, Tree Trunks?! Is that what you think adventurers do?! Die and make all their friends feel terrible 'cause they couldn't save them?!
  I'm going home now.| Ugh... Tree Trunks. Tree Trunks!
  Don't follow me. Oh, Finn... You shouldn't yell at cuties that just wanna help you. OH!| Man, I feel horrible. I was only yelling because I care about her safety.
  Finn, I found the crystal gem apple.| Woohoo!
  You're the man, Tree Trunks!| Tree Trunks, I'm a huge butt guy for getting mad at you. I'm a huge fart. I was only upset because... I love you and I don't wanna see you get hurt.
  That's precious, Finn, and I'll accept your apology if you let me kiss your cheek.| Uhhhh, I don't know, I--
  Uhhhh, I don't know...| A crystal guardian! Tree Trunks, stay out of the monster battle this time. I don't want you getting hurt.
  Alright, I promise I will.| Radical! Back off you!
  Back off you!| Stop copying me! Grrah!
  Stop copying me! Grrah!| Ahhhh! A-a-oww..
  Ow! Ow.| He's copying everything we do.
  Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks!| Gem-clam! Let's beat it up while it's copying Tree Trunks! Yaah!
  Crud, this is barf dude.| Oh, man, I'm a total moron! We gotta fight this one Tree Trunks style.
  I'll get the make up.| Hey! Crystal Guardian, are you okay with Tree Trunks taking a bite of that apple?
  Okay!| Whoo! How's it taste, Tree Trunks?
  Please! Calm yourselves, my people. I am safe! Oh, thank you, Finn. You truly are my hero this day.| Cool.
   Hero... Hmmm... Heeeeerroooo... Hey, I just thought of something!| Uhh... What'd you think of?
   Math. Hurry, Finn!|  No way!
   Here it is. Check it out.| A magical globe?
  No, Finn. It's what you can see through the globe.| Golly!
   Look. See this book?| Yeah, I see it!
  It's called the Enchiridion. It's a book meant only for heroes whose hearts are righteous.| Shmow-zow!
  The book lies at the top of Mount Cragdor, guarded by a manly minotaur. It's waiting for a truly righteous hero to claim it!| Do you think I've got the goods, Bubblegum? 'Cause I am in to this stuff!
  Yeah, I know. And yes, I do.| Then off I go!
  Then off I go!| Jaaaaaaaaake!
  Jaaaaaaaaake!| Thanks, pal.
   Farewell, Fi—Oh, wait a minute...  Farewell, Finn the human boy!| Bye, Princess!  You know what time it is, buddy?
  Aaaaadventure time?| Yeah, man!
  Oh ho! You've unlocked the riddle of the door.  Brilliantly done, child! Please, reveal to me how you unraveled my clue.| I just thought you'd look cute stuffed in that lock.
  Oh, yes. That's how most people get in.| Bye!
   Enchiridion is...  That way.| What?! Dude! You can't smell the book from here!
  It's in the castle on top of the mountain.  In a room.  Wish you had one, huh?|  This way!
  What about the book?| It can wait. Someone needs our help.
  Yo, Finn. Are you alright? Did you get brain damage?| I'm fine! Keep going! We have to hurry!
  I'm fine! Keep going! We have to hurry!| I gotcha.
  La la la-la!| What?!
"  Every time you say ""what"" we'll destroy an old lady."|  What?!
"  Every time you say ""no"" we'll destroy an old lady."|  No! Wai...
   No! Wai...| Please...
  Please...| Don't destroy...
  Don't destroy...| Anymore...
  Anymore...| Old women.
  Hey, Finn. You okay?| No way, dude. Those old ladies are destroyed because of me. I'm not righteous. I'm wrongteous. Stupidteous.
  Awww. Don't let those gnomes and their illusions get you down. They're just gnomes and illusions.| Illusions?
  Yeah, man. Think. What would regular, old, sweet ladies be doing wandering the hills of Mount Cragdor?| Maybe they're lost?
   No way. This place is designed to mess you up. To mess with your head. None of this is real. It's all just trials to test your heroic attributes.| Hmmm... Hmmm!
  Now let's go get that book.| Yeah! You're the smartest dog I know, man.
  Yeah! You're the smartest dog I know, man.| Jake? Jaaaaaaaake!
  You cannot pass!| Gimme back my friend!
   It's ok, Finn! I can get out!| Let Jake go, or I'll...  I'll kick your foot!
   Don't worry, dude! I found another way—oof!| Huh?  I'm coming, buddy!
   I think your dog finally fell into my stomach. Hey... Where'd you go?|  I got your wallet, man!
  No! My big money! Give it back!| Give me back my friend!
  But I killed him already!|  Fine.  I'll give you your dollar.  Here's your dollaaaaaarrrrr!
  Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa-oa!|  Jake!  You're okay!
   You're under arrest for stealing my dollar! | Just a minute, Jake.
  You know what that was? That was righteous.| Thanks, Jake. Now sniff out that book for me.
  Congratulations, Finn the human. You must be truly righteous to have made it this far.| Thank you.
  Now! Enter my brain-world, and I will show you some aspect of yourself that you're not entirely aware of.| Where... am I?
   For your final trial, slay the beast!| Why? Is it an evil beast?
  Yeeeeessss. It's completely evil. Will you slay it?| Shoot, yeah. I'll slay anything that's evil. That's my deal.
  Yeeeeessss! You've done well, hero.| Thank you.
  Now! As one last, last trial... Slay this ant!| Is it evil?
  No! But it's not good either. It's, uh, neutral. Will you slay it?|  No!
  If you want the heroes' Enchiridion, then slay this unaligned ant!| Never. Never. Never!
   Congratulations, Finn the human. Now you have truly reached...| Never!
  Ooh!| Oh, no! Mr. Key-per! I-I'm sorry. Why are you wearing that little devil costume?
   Finn... Jake... You made it!| Are you another trial?
  Trial? Oh, no!  I'm Mannish Man, the minotaur.|  The manly minotaur from Princess Bubblegum's story!
   The manly minotaur from Princess Bubblegum's story!| So, can I check out the Enchiridion? Can I? Can I? Can I?
  We've been watching you guys on our magical viewing globe. Take a seat guys, have some juice. There's grape and apple and the gatekeeper made spaghetti. And... Alright, Finn. Are you ready for this?| The Enchiridion!
   You deserve it, Finn.| Really?
   Hey! Crack open that book and read something for fun's sake, alright?| Oh, yeah.  Whoa. How to Kiss Princesses? 
   Hey. Don't tell her, Finn.| It doesn't say anything, Princess.
   Mannish Man!|  Awwww... Yeah!
  Ooo!|  I know what you need.
  What's that?|  You want your little baby socks, for your little baby feet.
  Woo!|  Baby!
  Yeah?|  I know what you crave.
  Oh, yeah? What's that?|  You want to poop your pants all day long. Well, baby behave!
  Hey, how can you sing like that, dude?| Remember when I swallowed that little computer?
  Oh, yeah.| Alright, Stanley. You and your family are safe... Again...
  W-whoa!| What the... Shmow-zow! Look at that!
  That... is the most adorable thing I have ever seen. And he loves your baby song. Sing some more of it, dude.| Alright.  Baby! You lookin' so good. You lookin' like you might... want some baby food.
  Keep it going, man! |  Baby! You lookin' so fine. You lookin' like you might... just start cryin'.
   Yeah!| Dude! This guy... is a pal for life! It looks like he's got two jiggly bellies stuck together.
  Whoa!|  He's the Jiggler.
   He's the Jiggler.|  You are the best thing ever. Let's take the Jiggler back to the house and just stick him by our bed so we can wake up...
  Next to a little dancing guy every morning!|  I gotta tuck you in, girl. I gotta sing you sweet melodies about babies. Yeah!
  Little baby feet!|  Welcome to your new home. Feast your eyes on... everything!
  What are you doing?| Splitting my toothbrush in half, so he can use half.
  Splitting my toothbrush in half, so he can use half.|  Here you go. It's for your teeth.
   Here you go. It's for your teeth.|  Like this.
   Like this.| Yeah! You got it.
  Enough hygiene.  Let's get to it!| Yeah! Toothbrush dance.  This is cool!
   Dance... dance...  dance...  I'm not tired! How about you, Jake?|  Maybe we should go upstairs.
   Maybe we should go upstairs.|  You can have the comfiest spot on the bed. Goodnight. 
   Mornin'.| Are you ready to get down?  Let's get this party started!
   Yeah, ok.| Where's the little guy?
   Over there.| Hey, pal. You ready to cut loose? Wake and shake, buddy. Let's do this thing! 
  Slam-a-cow! That fool looks rumped.| What do you mean?
  Well, look at him. He's all limp... and weird.| Aww... I bet he just needs some breakfast after a night of extraordinary jiggling. Hey! Let's combine everything we can find in the kitchen... and have the Jiggler drink it! That'll wake him up! And then we can... Get  doooowwwn!
  He doesn't want to drink that goop, man.| Then let's just give him some, uh... purple whatevers.
  You mean the grapes?| Yeah. Whatever.
  Yeah. Whatever.| Hey! I think he's diggin' it!
  | Uhh...
   Uh, you think we... think we fed the wrong hole?| Nah. He just doesn't like purple whatevers. What we need to do is figure out what he likes to eat.
  Nah. He just doesn't like purple whatevers. What we need to do is figure out what he likes to eat.|  Here, Jiggler. What kind of food do you like? Meat? Some banana? This looks like corn... I think. Uh... hot dog. Stanley the watermelon.
   Here, Jiggler. What kind of food do you like? Meat? Some banana? This looks like corn... I think. Uh... hot dog. Stanley the watermelon.|  Look! Jake! He likes it!
   Look! Jake! He likes it!|  Wow!
  No way!| His favorite food... is drawings! Awesome!
  Holy fig, that's awesome! What food are you drawing now?| I'm drawing a picture of you.
   Well, don't feed it me!|  Come on. Eat him up, Jiggler!
   Ahhh! Keep it away! Shoo! Shoo! |  Alright. Alright. I got it. Calm down... I'll eat it.  Ahhhhh.
   Dude! You eating me is just as bad as the Jiggler eating me.| Well... You gonna eat yourself, tough guy?
  | Ok. Alright. Now, let's get back to some jiggling!
  Whoa!|  Jiggler?
  What the heck? What's wrong with him?| Uh... There's nothing wrong with him. We just gotta plug up his holes.
  Uh... There's nothing wrong with him. We just gotta plug up his holes.| See? That worked. Ready to jiggle again, little guy?
  See? That worked. Ready to jiggle again, little guy?| Whoa!
  Oh, man...|  Quick! We gotta plug those holes!
   Quick! We gotta plug those holes!| Jake, hurry!
  All I could find was your glass eye collection!| What about your eyepatch collection?
  Aw, man. They're in mint condition.| Jake!
  One... more... patch!  Finished. Ugh. He looks terrible. Finn, I know you don't want to hear this, but I think we should cut our losses and bring this fella back to where we found him.| We can't just abandon him. Look at him, Jake. He needs us now more than ever.  Just need to take better care of you from now on, right little guy?
  We can't just abandon him. Look at him, Jake. He needs us now more than ever.  Just need to take better care of you from now on, right little guy?| Jiggler!
  Oh... Finn. Ok... Our pet exploded.| 
  Maybe we can... scrape him up! And... eyuhh...|  Oh, holy moly! Don't worry, Jiggler. We'll fix you. 
   Oh, holy moly! Don't worry, Jiggler. We'll fix you. | Let's gather him up, Jake. He's all over the place... even between the floorboards!
  And the cupboards!| And the galoshes!
  Hey!| Come on. Let's put him back together.
  Ok.| Squeeze real hard. He's slipping!
  Sheesh. You think he's dead?| No way! I won't let you die, guy! Not this time.
  Finn. Stop it, man. What are you doing?| I'm kissing him! What do you think? It's all I could think to do.
  I think he's trying to tell us something. Finn, this looks like it could be his Mama Jiggler| We took this child away from its mama, Jake. We're kidnappers and murderers! I just wanted to have fun and jiggle!
  Look... Chill out, ok? We can fix this. Check it out.  His mom looks like she's out by Stanley's house... where we found the Jiggler. If we get him back to her, she'll be able to fix him up!|  Then there's no time to spare.
   Then there's no time to spare.|  Shhh. Just hold on a little longer, buddy.
  Did you hear that? Whistling!| Perpendicular! It's the mama!
  Look! The little guy wants to go home!|  Well. This is it, buddy.
   Be well.|  Hey! Stop that!
   Hey! Stop that!| I don't understand. That crazy mama almost killed him.
  He feels cold.| What are we supposed to do now, man? We can't bring him home, or he'll... or he'll...
  What are we supposed to do now, man? We can't bring him home, or he'll... or he'll...| Dang it! Why doesn't she love him? I love him!  You love him! It's not fair!  Ahhhh!
  Finn, wait!| Mama's supposed to love baby! She's supposed to love baby!
   Oh, man!| It's yours, idiot!
  It's yours, idiot!| Don't you recognize your own baby?
   Finn! I figured it out, dude. It's the juice. The Jiggler needs to smell like its mama's juice. That's how wild animals know what’s going on... and this guy right here is all drained out. We gotta toss it in the soup, brother.| Alright. Ok.  I loved you, baby. I hope you know that.
  Alright. Ok.  I loved you, baby. I hope you know that.|  Word to your motheeeerrrrr!
  Awww...| I'll never kidnap again.
 Other| Unhand Princess Bubblegum!!
 Other|  Whoa!  Ah!
  Huh? Hee hee hee!| Hey, Ice King! I bet you'll never kiss the princess!
 Other|  You just kissed Jake's butt!
  What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys.| You're welcome, Princess.  Uh... 
  That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum?| I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift... in return for throwing us this party.
  Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt.| What?
  I bet you wish you were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish you were the Ice King and the princess was my butt!| What?!
  Hmm...  OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha!| That's ridiculous!  Huh? Uggghhh!!  What's so funny?
  Who's ready to party?!| What's everyone laughing at?
  Oh! I feel so great!| Who is that guy?
  Greetings, party-goers! Glad you could all make it!| Princess Bubblegum!  Princess. I just wanted to thank you for—
   Oh, my gosh! PB, ya gotta check out this super cute guy. You're gonna love 'im. | Uhhh...
   It would be my pleasure, Princess.| Why didn't the princess invite me to dance?
  If you wanna dance, just go dance!| But now she's dancing with him! Ah... I feel... weird!
  Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy.| BLAAAARGH!!
  Correct!| Agh!  They're talkin' about science, man! I can't compete with that!
  Do the Science Dance! Remember it? It was sorta like this.  Wah unh we ah eeh...| You think that'll work?
  Yeah! Probably.  Do it, man! You're a pro!|  Science Dance! Science Dance!
   —lower proximities to—| Science Dance! Hey, eh, Princess! You wanna spend some time with me?
  Oh, uh... Alright!  Finn, what the cabbage? I was learning about Zanoits!|  Oh... I'm... into Zanoits! Th-They're the best!
  Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of Plantoids a year.| Oh, no, not the Plantoids!
  Plantoids produce mellotoxin!  Mellotoxin kills Zanoits!!| ...So are Zanoits... good things?
   You're totally jealous of Ricardio.| No, I'm not. I just don't like the way he talks to you. It makes me feel weird.
  That's jealousy, hun.| I'm not jealous! I'M WEIRD!!!
   Woof! Man... This is goin' bad. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait.  Wow, man, what happened out there?| Agh... I don't know! I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and—
  Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too.| I know! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain.
  Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?| No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister!
  Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry.| I'll prove he's a villain!
  How?| Stakeout.
  Stakeout.| Here he comes!  They're talking!
"  Lemme see.  I can read their lips.  ""Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!""  ""You look kind of like a big pink baguette!"""|  Get serious, Jake!! This is life and death!
  Is it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just looks wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice.| I gotta trust my gut!
   Hmm.| He's on the move! Let's roll!  I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottles—and pretending to stab someone!
  So... he's recycling... or what?|  I think your gut's a little naive, Jake.  Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something!  Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!
  So I was right! He is a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious!  You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!| No way. This proves he's a super-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!
  No way. This proves he's a super-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!| Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!
  Oof!| So what're you doin', Ricardio? Are you evil?
  That's none of your business.| The safety of Princess Bubblegum is my business!
  Yeah.  Yes!| You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff!
  Now that my plan is nearly complete, there is no way you could stop me.| I could stop you if I wanted!
  Oh, yeah?| Yeah!
  Oh, yeah??| YEEEAAAH!!!
   What's going on here?| Princess?!
  Finn... why'd you do it?| He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!
  Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business.| But...
  C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy. |  She hates me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio.
 Other| Ice King! What do you know about this? Tell me or I'll do something!
  Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged!| I don't care! I only care about Ricardio!
 Other|  Agh! Come on, Jake!  Gotta save the princess!
  Princess Bubblegum!!| Princess!! 
  You were right all along, Finn! Now I'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it!| Not if I can help it!
  Shut your mouth up, Princess!  I'm gonna smooch that heart!! It will be my bride!!| Why don't you marry someone your own size?! Like my foot?!
  Huh?!| And my fist?!
 Other| Ice King.  Should we... let 'im take his heart back? He is... villainous...
 Other| No, she won't!
  Thanks again for saving me... again.|  Don't mention it.
  Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore. | I never get jealous.
   Kiss me, Finn.  Ahem.  I mean... kiss me, Finn.  Am I doing it right, Jake?| NOOOOOOOO!!!
  Yeah!  Yeah!| I found another bike and more computers. What do you got?
  WHAT THE HECK, MAN?! And they're all lefties! Sorry I'm not finding any loot.| Keep it together, chubby, because I think we found enough scrap to finish building our gauntlet dock; a dock that is also a gauntlet.
  Aww. Building this gauntlet dock is hard, man. Hard work sucks.| Don't be lazy, Jake.
  Don't be lazy, Jake.| Huh?
  Incoming iceberg!| Whoa! That one's huge!
   It's a guy.| Creepy. It's a buncha guys.
  You know what they remind me of? Well-dressed pickles.| Stand back, Jake! I'm gonna melt 'em outta there! Full charge.
  Ah. Perfecto. Bon appetit.| Hey! Can you hear me? Hello?
   I don't think they made it.| Hey.  This one's got some kind of pack.
  I remember... business.| Let go! Let go! Let go!
 We... are Business Men.| Oooh... Well, I'm Finn and he's Jake.
  Been frozen... so long, I...  can't remember. Can't remember! Oh. Looking for help, your business? We love work for you.| Nah. Adventurers don't need any help.
  Yes. This dock-ka... could be more... efficient.| No! Wait!
  No! Wait!| Jake, this dock is our fun pie. We should be the ones to bake it.
  Finn. These poor souls are lost without jobs. We can't ignore their plight.| Uhh...
  Woo!| Well... they do seem really happy to do it.
   Uhh... We finish.| Whoa!
  Told ya so.| Come on! Let's try it out!
   Yeah! Woo!  See? If we hire them full time, they'll be back in business and we'll be able to focus on fun stuff. Everybody wins!| Maybe you're right.
  Help! Somebody help!| Trouble, dude! Get your axe! I'll get my... wha?
  Adventure pack... ready for you.| Hey, thanks man.
  Hey, thanks man.| I have to say, Jake. My sword is totally shiny and stinkin' sharp!
  Uh huh.| Even my shoes feel different. Not only are they clean, I feel radder, faster, more... adequate.
  Help!| Don't cry, Hot Dog Princess! Jake and I will fend off these battle cubes!
   Me too. These cubes are... frickin' resilient. Hey, business dudes! Hold off these cubes so we can catch our breath?| Jake! They don't know how to fight.
  These guys are great, right?| I gotta admit... they are helping.  Oh! I think I figured out how to defeat the battle cubes!
  That's 'cause you had time to rest your body and refresh your brain.|  Ok! We'll take it from here, guys!
  Yeah! Good work.| Grab all the cubes together!
  Got 'em!| It worked!
  It worked!| Wake up, Hot Dog Princess. You're free.
   I take one for team.| This is awesome! You get a promotion, fella.
  Oh... Lost again!|  My turn.
  Freakin' awesome, man.| What are they doing?
  Takin' care of business.| Jake, hit me!
  Yeah!| We beat Adventure Master!
  Holy moly!| We're adventure masters!
   Ooo.| I never knew being fat and lazy was so rewarding.
  Yeah.  You're gut's so huge and moldable.| Hey!
  Hold on a sec!|  Man, that tickles.
   I'm the Ice King, and I'll never find a bride because I'm such a tool.|  Alright, let me try.
   Alright, let me try.|  I'm Princess Bubblegum and I'm a dork, because I like science! I've also got a really annoying voice that Finn thinks is attractive!
  Man, I am not in the mood for saving Lumpy Space Princess.| Hey, business dudes!
  Hey, business dudes!| What do you guys think?
  Ahh. Nice call, dude.| Imagine how awesome the adventure's going to be when it's time for us to go out there.
  Help us!| Huh? Jake! Did you hear that?
  Help! Please!| I heard it again.
   Woo-hoo! Woo!| Jake! We messed up! The businessmen have gone bat-crazy, dude!
   Man, just let the businessmen handle it.| THE BUSINESSMEN ARE THE PROBLEM, you lazy plug-hole!
   Huh?|  Guys!
   Guys!| Guys, stop it!
  Guys, stop it!|  Stop it, guys!
  Stop what, boss?| You're jacking up those Fuzzy Friends!
  But... We're being heroes. Like you, boss. We're protecting them. Collecting them in our care-sack so they cannot be hurt. It's the most efficient way to save people.| But you're making them unhappy!
  Irrelevant! These people are in our care-sack. Their happiness is not priority.| I am your boss! And you guys are all fired!
  Nooo! Alright, guys. Now I've gotta take you down... Finn style.| I'm kicking your care-sack, dudes!
  Ahh. I'm so fat, dude; I don't know what to do.|  That's it! Jake! Demoralize them!
  What? Why?| Do it, man! I have a legit plan!
  Huh? They're sucking me up, dude!| Now, eat that ice cream some more to become fatter, while also using your Stretchy Powers to grow huge!
  This sucks.| Yeah, dude! Keep growin'! You're breaking apart their robot!
   I'm going to kill you, not-boss!| Wait, man! Wait! I wanna re-hire you guys!
  Re-hire? Really?| Yeah, mans.
  So, wait... What'd you hire them to do?| I hired them to stuff themselves in that iceberg and get outta here.
   I'm gonna miss 'em. And I'm gonna miss this gut.|  I'm gonna miss my gut too.
   I'm gonna miss my gut too.| Huh? Aww...
  Who are these guys? This is a great fight!| Yeah! You never fought them? They come out every day at four o’clock on the dot.
 I guess that's because I meet Lady Rainicorn every day at four o'clock on the dot. Oh shoot! I'm late!| You should stay, man. At five o'clock every day, I chop both their heads off, and they grow them back for the next day.
  Aw, man, that sounds awesome! I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend.| Boo!
   I should probably go. I'll see ya later, buddy. | Bye! Hyaaaaaaaaah! 
  Ah, isn't this great? This is totally great.  Isn't it?| Yeah.
"  맞아. (""You’re right."") "|  What? What did she say?
  She said she also thinks it's great.| Oh.
  Hmm...  Hey, did you know that you both have an awesome sense of humor?| We do?
  Yeah! Anybody have a joke?| Oh, I have a joke!  Okay,  okay. Knock knock.
"  She said, ""who's there?"""| Diarrhea!
"  어, 나도 들었어. 뭐야, 하나도 재미없잖아. (""Oh, I got it too. What was that? It hardly qualifies as a joke."") "| Did she say diarrhea who?
"  글쎄.. 뭐가 있었을까? 아! 우리 완전히 다 벗고 상추밭 미친듯이 뛰어다닌 거 기억 나?  그 농부 아저씨 완전 맛이 갔었지! (""Maybe... What could it have been? Ah! Do you remember when we got completely naked, and frantically ran around in the farmer's cabbage patch?  That farmer got crazy mad!"")"| What's the joke?
  Uhh... well, the joke doesn’t translate very well.| Man, I- I might leave. Is it okay if I leave? I kind of want to go fight something.
 Noooo! Don’t leave.  If there was only some way you two could talk to each other directly.  Oh, dude! I just remembered! There's a universal translator device at the bottom of Lake Szelezon!|The lake guarded by evil Lake Knights?
  Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there. Let's all go and get it!| Whoa   Jake! You’re inviting Rainicorn? No offense, but isn't she a little too sweet for deadly adventure?
  Trust me, Finn, she’s the Rowdy Queen. She can do anything!| Hmmm. Alright! Trust pound!
"  고마워, 나도 재밌었어. (""Thanks, I enjoyed it too."")"| Uhhh, what?
   ... and then I ate all the peaches in the orchard, and that farmer was sooo angry!|  I like this voice!
  Hop on my back and I'll give you a ride home!|  Whatever you say grandpa!  Hai-yah!
   I remember why I drowned that translator now.| Hey grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings?
  Lady! It's a little rocky in the back seat here!|  Shmow!  That forest wizard is giving away free power rings!
  Do you wanna try gettin' some Finn?| Yeahs! 
   Laaaadyyy!  Fiiiiinn!  Lady!   Lady! Finn!  Y'all around here?  Dang it! |  Whoa! Did you see that!? This is like the funnest thing ever!
   There you are!  Where were you guys?| Wait a minute, you didn't fly down with us?
   Ooh! Honey pot, we probably couldn't here you because of the cloud density.| Jake! Check out these power rings! 
  Whoa. That's cool! You got ten of them?| Yeah! Lady got some too.
   Oh, that’s cool.| Uh, You want one of mine? I’ve got so many.
  Yeah! Thanks man!| Oh. Wait, I can't take them off. I guess they're cursed.  Still pretty cool though.
  Yeah, they're awesome. |   Alright this time I’m gonna destroy you Rainicorn!
  Oh, okay.  That sounds nice.| Oh I got the sword!
  Oh.  Hey Finn. After this next game do you wanna go adventurin' with me?| Lady and I are going to a party in the Cloud Kingdom tonight.  You should go to that with us.
  Humph! Humph Humph Humph!  | Jake stop sighing you're messing up my game!  Jake!  What’s goin' on with you!
  Mmmm, Nothin'!| Awww dang it! Man, Lady, you’re too good at this! Hey, It's time to party with clouds! Jake, you comin'?
  No!|  Dude, I thought you wanted to spend more time with me and Lady together?
  I do. | Then come on.
  No YOU go ahead!  And YOU have fun with MY girlfriend!| Uhhh...  We're gonna head to the party, but you should meet us there and stop acting weird. 
   What the-! |   Yeah! Now make that orange!  And make that purple!  Wow Lady! Hanging out with you it the best!
"  Nooo  oooooo! My girlfriend... in the arms of my best pal!  Well, TWO can play at that game, sweet cheeks!  Let's see... ""Doug, Todd, Jerry, Dennis, Reggie, Peter, George, Larry, Luke, David, Benton, Mike R., Mike H., Mike A., Gareth, Jennings, Mr. International, Mr. Outrageous, Captain Majesty, The Flying Lettuce Brothers, Pete the Punk""...  Tiiffaanyy!  PERFECT! Muhuhaha! "|  Man, I wish Jake was here having fun with us.  Hey, where’s that music coming from?
  Oh, hey guys. I'm just sharing a tender moment with my beautiful friend Tiffany.| Stop! You're making Lady jealous!
  Well I’m trying to make you both jealous!|  Why would I be jealous of Tiffany?
   Jake's MY best friend now! FOREVER!|    Yaaaaaaahhh!  Home wrecker! 
  I know. Gaah.|  Get out of my life Tiffany! And never come back 
  Yeah! Waaay better! | Beat it Tiffany! Go on! Get!
   I'm sorry I was an idiot. Forgive me?| Shut up man, I don't wanna hear that stuff.  Lemme get in there.
  Let's never be stupid again.| Wait! Let's always be stupid! Forever!
   What'd you say? Whoa! | I think someone's crying.  Stop!  This is serious! I gotta go find out where that crying is coming from! 
  Ohhhhhhhh! |  What did you call me?
  You can't just walk away from a roughhouse!|  Hey! Listen up you cold-hearted marauders! Someone's out there crying for help and I'm not gonna ignore that!
  Awwww here it comes! Lay it down Finn!| A long time ago when I was a baby, I went boom boom on a leaf. Boom! Boom!  And I fell backwards and sat in my own boom boom. I cried for a day. But no one came to help me.  That day I vowed to help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem.  And that's why I need to go. 
   He still cries when he poops. Thanks for being cool guys. Wait up, Finn!  It's comin' from up there!| Someone must be caught in that avalanche! Let's get it on!  So, who's crying?
  I am.| Whoa! Aww, what's wrong fella? You cryin' boulders?
  Yes, I am sad. Having been forced to watch roughhousing men for centuries.| Ohhhh! I see. You're feeling left out and you wanna roughhouse too! Well I can take you on tough guy! Come on Jake! Back me up! 
  Please! No roughhousing! It…m-makes…me…soooo.. SAD! | Huh? Why?
  Because they're so rough on each other!|  But a smooth well controlled roughhouse bolsters your guts and rejuvenate the muscle.
  Whoa. This guy's got problems.|  
  Honey! Don't look! That kid's got problems! | I'll help you mountain!
  Whoa! What?| I'll stop those roughhousers from being rough!
  Really? You'd do that for me?| Yes sir! My name's Finn and I'm gonna help you out!
  But Finn, we're not gonna shut down the roughhouse for real are we?| No way! But there's got to be some kind of solution. I’ll figure this out Mountain Man!  Yup!
  Aw! Finn! Ready to get destroyed?| N-nooo! Wait, um, actually, could you guys stop being so rough?
  Whoa whoa whoa!  What are you talking about Finn?| Could you guy just tone down the roughhousing a little?
  Whoa! Hey, hey. Shh. It's all right fellas. Finn, I'm sure this tone down the roughing thing has something to do with your boom boom, and I can respect that, but how can we POSSIBLY, make roughhousing, less rough?!|  I think I have a perfect idea!  This'll soften your punches for smooth knock outs. Like punching a dream!
  That’s like math. | Mathematical.  What do ya think? Fixed all youe problems right?
  No! That was terrible! Now they’re just punching animals! It’s worse than before and it’s in no way a good solution!| I’m sorry!
  Aw, man.| Come on Jake. I gotta give this another shot!
  Finn this guy seems like a real nut job. You know what I mean? I don’t wanna get sucked into this guy’s hang-ups.| Yes I do Jake. That’s what I vowed! To help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem!  At least I have to try brother.
   So be it brother.| Hey guys. I’m back.  Hey guys. Guys? Men! Men. Please stop a second. Men! Boys? Please? I have more to ask of you! Bros? My bros?  Brother?
  Well I’ll pet you back! Wha-whoa. What the-? This is awesome! | Alright! This could be it! 
   Maybe you can solve everyone's problems. Like a cherub with its bottom out.|  Okay, cool. Hey, I'm gonna go tell the mountain.
  Alright I’m gonna-  stay here this time.|  So, everything's fine this time, right?
  Yes! Thank you Finn!|  So the mountain is totally fine with everyone petting. I feel great.
  Right on man! The marauders are going crazy over the petting! They're petting each other raw! Check ‘em out!|  They look kinda rashy.
  Hey Finn! Hey man. As you can see the petting got sorta out of hand.  Stop that! We are done with that! We’re going back to roughhousing!| No wait fellas! The mountain doesn't like roughhousing.
  Well we don’t like not roughhousing! Ya see the problem here?| Well. Well what if we rotate the entire mountain 180 degrees around, so the mountain’s facing the other direction. That way, you guys can keep roughhousing and the mountain doesn't have to watch it!
  Sounds fine with me!| What do ya say mountain!
  Oh! Thank goodness! Alright kids, spin me the math around!| Now I just need to set up some sort of pulley system.
  Huh? What? Really!?| What!? A-but-ahh. Um, maybe what we can do is...
  Excuse me. We need your help. There’s no music playing and we desperately want to dance!| Oh, ah just a second you guys. I’ll a- I’ll help you out in one minute.
  Hey! Pipe down over there! I want some peace and quiet!| Let me just a-
  I need to be pollinated!| Huh!?
  Pollinated all over to make my babies!| Everybody please! One problem at a time!
   What’s happening!|  Ahhhhh! Everybody wants different things! And some of them want stuff that’s exactly the thing the others don’t want.
  You just kissed a boom boom baby. So don’t expect any more sugar from me, sweetheart until we wash your dirty dirty face. |  Hmm. Jake. What I want is to help anyone in need, so everyone is happy!
   Wow, that’s pretty corny man, but let’s do it dude! Wooohoo!|  Ready over there mushroom gang?
  Ready Finn!| Ready dragon?
  Yes sir!| Ready Mountain Man?
  …I’m ready.| Go!
   Stop! I've got a problem.| Well, what's the matter?
  This dolphin fell in love with me!| That's the opposite of a problem!  Adventure Time!
  Yeah?| You ever wonder what a demon's heart looks like?
  Of course, dude.| You ever wonder what a demon's heart tastes like?
  Hey, kid... You want some magic powers...? Magic powers for absolutely free...| Heck yeah!
   Wait! Let's not be too rash! Just look at this guy!  Check out the sunken, lifeless eyes... The foul stench of decay... You know what that means?| Means he's evil, I guess.
  Well, evil, sure... but mostly, he's unattractive, and unattractive people are desperate. You should haggle with him!|  Hey! I want more than just free powers! What else ya got?!
  Alright... Free magical powers and...  Eh! And this keychain.|  OH! OH! OH!
   Play it cool, Finn.| Right.  I begrudgingly accept your offer.
   Yes... Then the deal is struck!  WAHAHAHAHAHA!  You can pick up your powers right through that door.   This way...| This place looks magical. You think this is where we get the powers?
  Yes, I do.  Free powers for all. Want some?| Yeah! Are you the guy handing 'em out?
  You seek Bufo, the wizard!| So, where's that guy?
   He is here, of course.| Uh...
   We are Bufo!| Ohhhh...
  Oh, boy!| Yes, we do! Can't wait!
    Then follow....| Whoo-hoo!
  Behold the Grand Hall of Wizardry!  This is where young potentials train to become Ultimate Wizards! Most are not ready for the responsibility that comes with it.|  I'm responsible, dude!
  Yeah! So am I!|  That's a lie!
  Whoa!| Hey! This is a dress!
  Yeah! And I am into it! It's, like, gossamer!|  This way I won't be embarrassed!
  Fine, fine. Now for every power that you accrue,  you shall receive a star badge like these.  This final star betokens the rank of Ultimate Wizard!| Mark me, Jake. I shall have that final star!  Where do we start?!
  Level 1—Dustomancy.| Yeah! Dustomancy! Whatever that is! Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme!
  To receive this power, you must first...  eat these brooms.| Alright.  Ah, wait!  This is gross!! Man, I can't eat this!
  Yeah, you can! Do what I do! RAAAAWR!!  Oops.  Ah, there we go.| Whoooaaa! You got a star!
  Haha! Observe my magics!| Wait, Jake! Don't use 'em until I finish my broom!   Last... bite... 
   Dude, you got your star, too!|  WE'RE DUSTOMANCERS!  Nothing happened! This is a total ripoff!! Bufo! You tricked us! Stupid power doesn't even work!!
  Calm yourself, boy.  You are acting hysterical. Do you not see that you are using Dustomancy? Behold...| I'm doing this? So... I have—
  Well, that's... sorta cool.|" ""Sorta"" cool?!? THIS IS RADICAL!"
  Are you ready for more magic?| We get more?!
  So much more... like Level 2... the power of... Shadowcery!  You can't see through those, right?| Nope... Not at all.
  Thrust your hands into this bowl... of eyeballs.| Eyeballs?!
  No! They're eyeballs...  Well done. You have groped the eyeballs fearlessly.| Another star! Yeah! Shadowcery...  Onward, my shadow steed!  Huh?
  No touchies. | Wizard powers are so cool... I want ALL THE STAR BADGES!!!
  Well done.| All we're missing now is the big star! You ready to complete the set, man?
  Nah, I'm good.|  WHAT?! How can you stop now??
  Eh... I've got everything I need. A limitless supply of mayonnaise, this captivating new hairstyle... and I just learned the best spell of all!| What's that?
  Sleep.| Aw... What a lame-o.  Bufo! I'm ready to get that big star!
  To tell true, the last power is not free.| Wha?? You can't do this to me, man! I've got no money!
  No, no cash. For the final star, you must take the pledge of ultimate responsibility.|  Okay. I'll take that pledge.
  Are you sure? Perhaps you are not sufficiently familiar with—| I'm ready!
  Well, there may be ramifications that you cannot—|  Just let me take that pledge, man!
  My word, I've never met someone so irresponsibly responsible. Very well, then. You must... grasp my hand.| That's it?  Easy!  Huh?  My big star!! Yes!! Wha-hoo! Yeah!! Wait, where am I?
  Direct your attention to the scale-model orb.| Huh?  Is that an asteroid heading for this very temple?
  Yes. It's been heading for this temple for 847 years. Only the magic of the ultimate wizards keeps it from getting any closer. Quickly, add your power to that of the orb.| Oh, okay.  Whoa! I got it! Now what?
  And you take his place... for the rest of your natural life.| Awesome. ... Wait, what?!
  This is what you signed up for when you took the pledge of ultimate responsibility.| This is what all the wizard training was about?!  You tricked me!
  Young wizard! The asteroid approaches!| Oh, yeah. Sorry. 
  I tricked you, of course... but would anyone really volunteer to do this?  I'm out. | Aw, man, this sucks.  Old people! There's gotta be a better way!
  Nope... This is how the ancient ones wanted it.| Yeah? I've got a younger idea! 
  You fool! Your newfangled thinking will get us all killed!| Youth culture forever!  Whoa.
  Hey! Have you gone crazy?! Get back in the bouncy harness!| Sleep! 
  You are—! Uhh... | Ultimate Wizardry, activate!  ...Uh... Hm. Maybe my footing's off?  There you go!  I cast... Dragon Eyes! Tiger Claw! Vorpal Hand! Blazing Feet! Beauteous Wings! And finally... every other power I didn't mention by naaaame! With all my magics combined, I'm powerful enough to move the entire village out of the asteroid's path!   I need some help! Jake!! Awaken!! 
  Hey, I'm alive! What's that up there?  AH! OH, NO!| Hah... My stupid young idea will be responsible for hundreds of deaths!
   It sure will!| Huh? Old wizards! You ditched your responsibilities to help me!
  What? No! We left so we wouldn't be killed by that asteroid!|  Oh, okay, um, since you're here already, could you lend me a hand??
  Huh??| Whoo-hoo! Nice job! Thanks to us, the village is saved. And we reclaimed a few of your twilight years!
  Don't forget to thank me. For this was my plan for all of these 847 years.| No way! Your plan was to dupe a succession of rubes into keeping the asteroid at bay!
   Perhaps you're right. No more giving out free powers. I hereby renounce all magic.  My life is oveeeeeer!| Chill, man. You don't have to quit your job.
  I don't?| Nah. Just don't take credit for ideas that aren't yours.
  Hey, naked kid. you want some free... Demon heart?!| Aw, ha ha ha haw, yeah!
  Yes way, it did. And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist.| Ah, jeez! Jake, is this stuff you're saying true? Or are you just trying to mess me up? You have to be honest.
  Oh, it's true, man. I heard it through a reliable source.| Reliable? Rats!
  Yeah. Some say it haunted this very tree!| This tree?!
   Good niiiight...| Jake?
  Jake?| You're full of it, Jake!
  You're full of it, Jake!|Errr...  NO WORMS ON THE BED! 
 Errr...  NO WORMS ON THE BED! | Huh? 
  Huh? | AAAAAH!!! 
  AAAAAH!!! | Jake! Jake! I saw someone outside the window! It must be the vampire, and I think we're unprepared, so I--
  Relax, buddy. I made that story up. I was just trying to scare you.| But you said you heard it from a reliable source!
  Ha ha! I made that up, too. I was trying to scare you, and it worked! | No one's outside.
  Whew!| It was just the wind, scaredy-cat.
  I wasn't scared, I was singing. I was singing my scream song. Ahh! Ahh! AAaah-uh-aah!| You're a total wuss, man.
 Hey, guys. What's up? I'm Marceline the Vampire Queen.|  Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?!
   Calm down, weenies. I'm not gonna do that. | Soooo, you don't suck blood?
"  Ugh, I am exhausted. I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo. And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say ""like what?"""| Like what?
  And I fooled around in the Fire Kingdom. | OOO!
  Oh, and check these out. | Nuts?
 Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts. |  You're wonderful.
  You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going.| What?
  Come on, Finn. Let's get out of here.| She can't kick us out of our house!
  Finn!| Get down here, lady, and fight me!
  She's a vampire, dude!| I'm gonna kill her.
  Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question!| But, what about our home?
  A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house.| But I like our home.
  Finn, house-hunting is wild! You've got to try it.| Really?
  Yeah, man! It is so nuts!| You always know what to say.
  Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop!|(laughs) Okay. I'm convinced. Let's roll!
  Sweet, things are gonna start going our way.  Hey, look, see? What'd I tell ya?| This is weak! I don't even like any of these places. I wanna go home.
  Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means.  La, la, la...  Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue... Home is anywhere, where people care about you...| I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude! I just wanna go home...
   But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you!  With your lucky stars to guide you from above. | Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my... souse.
  I'd rather be dancing with some babes!|  Shut up, dude!
  Ew... Gross. This place looks gross!| And abandoned. 
  And abandoned. |  Whoa, bro... Wanna just live in here?
  So whaddaya think, man? We did pretty good for ourselves.| Yeah, we did... So, ah, what should we do first with our new digs?
  Let's trash it and throw a party!| Ah this is it, feelin' good, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' like we did it. I'm feelin', like, completely satisfied. Nothin' else could go wrong, ya know, Jake?
  Yeah, man.| Aww, yeah, I know, too.
  Wow, pretty awesome party ya got here.| What do you want, Marceline?!
  Oh, I just wanna show you somethin'. This cave belongs to me!| What!?
  Thanks for fixing the place up for me.| Y-You can't take our home twice!
   Yes, I caaaannnnnn!| AAAAAAAHHHH! It's vampire-fighting time!
  Finn! Nooo! Vampires will kill you... remember!?| But she's taking our home again!
  We're home as long as we're together, bla-bla-bleep-bla-bloop, remember!?| Oh, yeah. Okay, Marceline, I'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home, and he's way better than all your homes combined!
  | What!?
  Nooo!| Let go of Jake!
  Make me.| You okay, pal?
   No one... makes me... let go... of Jake!| I'm not scared of you!
   You're pathetic, little boy!|  You're pathetic!  Get ready for an uppercut, you dog!
  |  Jake!
  Uh oh.| 
  Ow! That actually hurt, Finn. | Why didn't you just kill me?
  Finn!| Aren't you dead?
   You two are pretty hardcore. I can appreciate that.| Soooo so does that mean we can have our old house back?
  Yeah!| Huh? Did you guys get on the bed? I told you, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED!
 You're totally slow dude, speed up them gams.|Auh... I'm not used, uh... to running on all fours! Oahh!
 Ready to admit it's harder than it looks?|I'll never admit anything to you. Hey where'd you go?
 Heh heh heh.| Whoa aoh oh! Umpf! Okay I admit it's, it's harder than I thought.
 Actually you did pretty good! Hey check it out!|Whoa!
 Looks like a giant dead turtle.|I think it's some kind of city of...
  Thieves! It's the City of Thieves! Be warned boy! All who enter the city are destined to be come thieves themselves!  Even you.|I would't become a thief lady! I'm a pretty good guy.
 Yeah, get your glasses on grandma, this kid is pure. In fact he's about to help that little crying kid. | Oh, whoa!
 Be warned!|Enough lady!  Hey little girl, are you okay?
  Please, don't steal anything from me!|Whoa! We wouldn't do that. We're heroes.
 Ahh! | Jake!
 I'll face the other way, but I'm gonna keep doing this.|So what's wrong?
 Oh, it was terrible. I was trying to sell my flowers out here in the desert, when these two thieves came and stole my whole basket! Then ran into the city.|The city?
 Heed my warning boy|Never.  I'll get this girl's flowers back-
 My name is Penny.|I'll get Penny's flowers back, and come out of that city as pure as the driven snow. Let's go Jake!
 Yeah! We're gonna purify that city!| Cool.
 My ring!| Stop thief!
  Stop thief!| Stop!
  My ruby!| Stop, baby! Don't steal!
  Stop, baby! Don't steal!| Don't steal, Mr. Turtle!
  Finn, it's hopeless to try stopping a thief here. Everyone steals from each other. It's redoodoodiculous!| Penny! Never say that!
  Redoodoodiculous?| No! The whole thing you said. About hopelessness. 'Cause I'm gonna get your basket back from whoever took it. And then I'm going to  beat my purity into them!
  And then I'm gonna beat your purity outta them.  And then beat a sandwich into them!  And then beat them to the punch! And then punch 'em!| We can beat these thieves while we search for Penny's flower basket!
  Okay.| Hey turd-le (turtle)! I'm gonna kick your butt! Also, have you seen this little girl's flower basket?
  Woah! I want jets!| Come back, Crossbow Guy!
  Hey, my basket! That's my basket!| Don't worry, Penny. We'll get it right after I deal with this guy!  Stealing's wrong, doofus!
  My glasses!| There it goes!
  There it goes!| I will smite thee, goblin thief!
  Hey! |  You there! It's time to step into the purification chamber, son!  Hey!
   You there! It's time to step into the purification chamber, son!  Hey!|  How are we supposed to get that basket back if it keeps being stolen?! 
  Hey! We can steal a new one from that guy!  He's got lots of flower baskets. And boots! I'd like to steal me one of them pairs of boots, especially.| No, Jake. We can't steal. We have to stay pure!
  I have an idea! My mom used to tell me that there's a King of Thieves who lives in the center of the city, and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower. Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest!| That's a great idea, Penny!
  There's one thing, though. The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier. Which magically keeps thieves out.| Have you forgotten?! We three ain't thieves! We're pure! Right, Jake?  Jake?
   Just gotta steal these boots...| Jake!
   Hey! Go away!| What are you doin', man?
 It's the city, it's getting to me. Help me, Finn!|I'm here for ya buddy. 
 Thank you Finn, thank you.| Nooo!  I won't let you become a thief! 
  Uh, what are these? | Bells. That way, I'll hear you if you try to steal again.
  The King of Thieves' tower is right up here.| Woah.  You read to pass through, Penny?
  I'm too afraid! Is it okay if I wait out here?| Sure. C'mon, let's go, Jake!
   Comin'! | Jake, where'd you get those boots?
  Huh, what? What boots?  Oh, no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me!|  Jake, you're a thief now! You won't be able to get in anymore!
  Yes, I can.  Oh. |  It's up to me, now.
  Legend says you'll find the loot in the King of Thieves' chest. Good luck, Finn! Oh, yeah, and that high window is the only entrance.| Hmm. Alright, wish me luck!
  She already did, man.| Oh, yeah. Right.  Great, now I gotta climb down?!  Huh?  The King of Thieves!  Sorry to trespass, I just... Uh, hello?  The chest! In it's in his chest! Thanks! 
  You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore.|  I got it, guys!
  The chest! Gimme that! | Huh?
  Woah, woah, woah. Easy, kid.| What?!  Is you basket under all that gold?
  Of course it's not! I set you up to steal this chest of gold! I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief!| But you're just a cute little girl!
  And, I'm a thief!| Well, if this isn't yours, I'm gonna return it right now!  Huh?  Why can't I...?
  Because you stole something in the city! Now you're a thief!| No!  No!!! What have I done?! What have I become?!
  You've become a thief, stupid! |  My hands. They're all dirty. Covered in the dust of a criminal act! I'm a thief!
  Hey, that's enough from you, Hag!   Finn?| Don't touch me! I'm impure, man! Unfit to be a hero! Unfit to be your friend.
  Come on, Finn, keep it together!| No, Jake. This is a one-way path, down a jacked-up road. And I gotta walk it... alone.
  I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city. You're my buddy. Besides, I stole these boots. These super-big style boots. So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We gotta walk this filthy path together!| Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny.
  Cowabunga! | Cowabunga, indeed.
   Mmm. Yes. Yeah.  Wha? Is someone there?! |  It's me, Penny. The hero whose purity you stole! And I'm here to enact my revenge upon you! 
  Finn, please don't punch my lights out! I'm just a poor, homeless baby girl.| I trusted you, Penny. You made me steal. And you took my purity. You ruined me!
  Watch out, Finn! | Thanks, dude.
  Nice work, dude.| She's purified!
   I feel...clean! Like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone! Thank you F and J! I haven't felt like this since I was young!| You're welcome.
  Woah, dude!  The soap got on us, too!| We're clean!
  Yes! | This good deed we did has purified us once again. We're virgin islands! 
  Finn, thanks for the second chance to live a pure life.| And you know what that means, Penny. No more stealing! 
  Never again.| Well, I think it's time for us to get the math out of here.
   I'm going to miss you, Finn!| I'll miss you, too.
  Woah, dude. Why are you naked? |  PENNY!
  Dude... how long are we gonna follow this frog?| I just wanna see 'im put on that crown.
  It looks cool in there!|  Too bad we don't have the key to this.
  What're you talkin' about?  I got two keys right here!| Whoo-hoo!
  Wow! Look at this place!| Jake. Are these donuts?
  They look like donuts.| But maybe they're poisonous donuts!  Yeah! Sniff it, Jake! Suck up those toxins!
  Hey!| What gives?!
  RAAAAAGH!! You're lying! The stink of magic dog lips is everywhere!| Holy slug, lady! Calm down!
  Uh-oh. | AAH!  Dude, are you okay?
  Ahahahahahehehe!| What did she do to you?
  I stripped him of his magical powers!| For stealing one of your billions of donuts?!
   I AM NOT MARRIED!| The point is you overreacted.
  Well, you can forget it because you're the one who's wrong!  ...Right?| Total support, dude.
   RRRRAAAARRGH!!  Go-backicus-from-whence-you-came-icus!| Aw, now you're just makin' these up!
   Are you alright, my... my donut pretties? Heh heh... Wait a second. YOU'RE A BAGEL! LIARS! LIARS EVERYWHERE! | There's gotta be a way to get your powers back! Where'd they come from, anyway? Were you born with them? Or... did you have a freak industrial accident?!
  Ha. That takes me back. Let me just...  remember.  I see a memory. When I was just a pupster... I'm rollin' around in a mud puddle, and I'm just... lovin's it. Oh, no!  Whoo... Remembering is hard work.| What happened next?!
  Oh. Um... I went into the mud, and... I guess I became a magic dog?| Okay! Then our course is clear! We'll roll you in every mud puddle in Ooo until we find the one that'll restore your powers.
   That's nuts, man. You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo? Four? Maybe even five?| Jake, come on! We've always been lucky, buddy! Maybe the first mud puddle we find will be the right one!
  Nonsense... but I like it!|  Then away! Hyuh! Whoo-hoo!
  Yeah, let's do it!| Oh, my gosh!
  I forgot that I don't have magic powers anymore. How do we search for the mud without my powers?| We run! Run like energetic little boys! 
   This whole time, I thought running was some sort of... leg magic.  Huh... Look at me. I'm runnin'!  Oh, no...   Running... is... evil...| Come on, lazy bones!
  It's too hard!| I guess you could ride on my backpack.
   I can't reach.  You good, Finn?|  You're... strangling me... a little, is all.
   You're... strangling me... a little, is all.| Look there! Across the River of Junk! There's an ideal mud puddle.
  I'll stretch into a boat!  I'm startin' to really miss that old magic of mine.| We can swim this river easy!  Come on, Jake! 
  Man, I'm glad I met you.| Jake! Stop talking to yourself! Cross over already!
  Uh, I can't swim that river, dude. My subconscious says it's too hard. Check out this hat, though.|  What's wrong with that guy?  Then just wait for me there!
  Whatcha workin' on, Finn?  Look at you! Doin' stuff!  Oh, is it a chair?  A chair for my butt—?  Mud-venture!| Did it work?!
  Oh, yeah! I can feel this workin'! In fact, you should roll in the mud with me, Finn! We can both be magic!| YEAAAAH!  This isn't working at all.
  This isn't the right mud. I was just really hopin' this was over and done.|  Okay... Then let's just go find another mud puddle.
  Actually... I'm feeling kinda chubby-tired. Can't we do this tomorrow?| Agh! This is stupid! Just go back to the witch and apologize and get your powers back!
  Never! I'd rather be powerless forever then apologize! I'm lazy but prideful.|  YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING, MAN!  First, you won't run,  a-and now you keep—and... a-and no matter what, I ju—you...
  Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers.| But you are an adventurer.
  Behold the beautiful mermaid of the river.  Which one of you mortals wants to mate with  all this? Heh heh heh...|" Oh, um... How do I say, ""You're the grossest thing ever,"" without offending you?"
  I'll scare her off, Finn! | How do we beat power like that?!
  Finn! I've got an idea!| What is it, buddy??
  Rub my belly! Yeah, I'm one of those kinda dogs.|  YAAAAH!
  Finn?  Finn! Come on, Finn! You gotta save yourself! I'm just a dog! Aw, man. Oh, geez... Okay. Then I'm back on the team!  I'll save you!| Jake? 
  Honey, I'm back! How about a big kiss?   You guys are so cute! I could just maul you to death!| Jake!  I never should have doubted you!
  Well, I'm glad you learned your lesson| Ahhh, so is that how you got your powers back? You apologized to the witch?
  Stop farting on me! It's gross!| You can't just go around stealing boots.
  | He's getting away in that lake!
  Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean.|  Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! ...Huh?
   Poots on newts!|  I'm coming, Jake. I'll poot on that newt as soon as I'm barefoot. Uh...
   Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts?| Ow!
  Ow!| Wh-wh-wh-Who are you?
  I am the manifestation of your fear... fear of the ocean!| What? I'm not afraid of lakes, wells, or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles. Why would I be afraid of- 
   'Cause you're a wuss.| I'm no wuss! I'm the hero around these parts!
  Ha! You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero.| Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'!
  Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'!|  I shall conquer my fear.
  Yeah, right.| No! I will. I'll conquer my fear.
  Dude. Dude, did you see me? I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this! Womp! Womp! And then... Hey, what’s wrong with you, dude?| Jake. I think I'm afraid... of the ocean.
  Say what, now?| I need your help to overcome my fear. Will you do it?
  Um... No... I don't really wanna do it.| Jake! Come on!
   Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop.| Don't be scared. I shall not be scared.
   Boop. Boop.| I'm afraid! Ah!  Jake, get me out of the water! Now, Jake! Now! Now!
  Hot jam! You're really scared of the ocean. In fact, you're so scared... it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean!| Jake!
  Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning.| But I must conquer this now!  I'm not afraid of you!
  But I must conquer this now!  I'm not afraid of you!| 
  |  I'm afraid of you! I'm afraid of you! 
   I'm afraid of you! I'm afraid of you! |  Ok, yeah. Let's try tomorrow.
  Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up.|  Morning, Jake.
  Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear?| Yeah, man.
  Cool... but I can only do this if you ask me.| I'm askin'!
  Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one!|  Jake, are you crazy? This is not an OK thing to do!
  Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends.| You're nuts. 
  Don't try to struggle, man.  I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down.| Really? Ok. I'm calming down.
  That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two?|  Yeah, man. I can do it.
  Alright, dude. Step... two! |  Jake, this isn't a joke! It's touching me!
  Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child!|  I'm trying to let it hold me.
  Control your breathing!|  This isn't working!
  That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream.| W-what?
  I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream.| What?!
  Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow!|  I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do?
  I think we should give up.| What? I made it all the way to level three.
  Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean this  is my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude.| You have to help me. I can't do this without you.
  Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore.| I swear I won't hit you anymore.
  And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times.| I swear... and pigs have hair.
  Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four.| What? I thought you said it was a three step plan... man.
  Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude.|  Yeah. It's pretty math... you psychopath.
  You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes.|  Whoa...
  See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful.| Hey. This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad.
   Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut.| No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!
  No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!| Noooo!
  Jake? Jaaaaaake!| Jake!
   Pathetic! You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die! Your un-heroic body will never let you save Jake. |  You're right.
  What? Really? You think I'm right? Well, that's... that's great!|  If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do.
  Jake! Jake! Wake up!| You ok, dude?
  Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear!| What?
  I'm proud of you man. You did it!| Thanks, dude.
  Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton?|  What the flip, man? I just swam to the bottom!
  No you didn't, cheater! You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero.| He's right. I'll never be a hero.
  Silence, Fear Feaster! We know a lot!| Wait... Why did you wait so long to tell me?
  Farewell, Finn. You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo.| It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster!
  What? Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life?| Everybody has a flaw... and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts.
   Are you okay, dude?| Yeah, why?
  You look bored.| Naw, that's just how I look when I'm listening to music.
  Well good, because I'm about to kick it up a notch.| Bring it!
  Bring it!|  Who do you think it is?
  Could be anybody. | Hmm... I can't quite make it out. 
 Other| Ahh! It's the Ice King!
 Other|  Eiiiiaah!
  Yeah! Kick his butt, dude!| Eat my sword, Ice King! 
  Eat my sword, Ice King! | Aww.
 Other| I will, though! With a sweet kick!  Psych! 
 Other| What's the good news?
 Other| Eww.
   This is weird, dude.| Hmm... if you get married, what about capturing princesses?
 Other| Ohhh...  well, fare thee well, Ice King!
  Yeah, good luck with ye and thy creepy wedding.| We totally support your decision to stop capturing princesses!  I'm happy for him. 
 Other| But we hate you.
  No. No, no, no, no, no.|  Dude, we gotta show him a good time and treat him right. Otherwise, he'll go back to imprisoning ladies! I-I can't have that! I—
 Other|  Bye, Ice King! Good luck!
  Have fun being married!| No more stealing princesses!
 Other| We just took you out partying so that you could feel better about getting hitched!
 Other|  Alright, here comes my double kick!
   Finn, Finn, cool yourself, buddy. We need to get this guy married, remember?| Yeah, I remember.
"   ""Why?""  Poots, that guy is good. Why? Why?"| Jake—
 Other| Well, uh... don't you wanna grow old with somebody? Right?  Just like these old swans.
 Other| Uhh... Yeah—I-I never—uhh... I guess it is.  Jake, this is bad news, man! We gotta go tell him that he can't eat his wife!
 Other|  Phew!
  All that's left is the lousy wedding. | I'm weddy for the wedding!
  I'm weddy for the wedding!| Y'know, even though the Ice King is a wad, I'm pretty happy for him.
  Uh-huh. This wedding looks lame, man.  Be prepared to be bored outta your mind.| 
 Other| Weird—and your bride is into that?
 Other| Well...  cool, man. I'm glad y'all are happy... being crazy together.
 Other| Huh? Her eyes are huge! I'm gonna go check 'em out.  And stop scratching your ear, man—it's gross.
  It wasn't me—it was my foot, dude.|  Whoa, you've got ridiculously large eyes, princess! Are you allergic to somethin'?
   No, Finn. I was just born like this.| Why are you crying?
  Help me!| What?!
  | He tricked me! And I was happy for that son of a toot!
  She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring.| That's what cursed her! Don't worry, princess. I'll remove this ring and save your life. 
 Other| No, man. You cursed her. She hates you!
 Other| Hyah!  What is wrong with you, man?! 
  Hehe, no problem.|  Ehh.
 Other| Huh? 
  Whoa! | Jake!
   Huh, what?| JAKE!  Grrrr.  Oh, hey.
  Hey.| You got the ring off her finger?
  Huh? Oh. Oh yeah. Now she's not hypnotized, but we're still frozen.| I got a plan.
 Other| Now!
  Yes, it's official.| It's official! You done married a dog, dude!
  Wait, what the—? What am I laughin' about?|  And now everything's back to normal.
   Alright, guys. Hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole. I've gotta jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk.| You got it, Princess.
  Ow. Ow. Ow.| There. That's the last sign, Jake. Now no one will go down this hole, ever. Probably a lot of dangerous, awesome stuff down this hole. I better go take a look.
  Don't, dude. For you see, that's the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye!| Whoa.
  Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon. Man, we shouldn't even be talkin' about it, 'cause it's lunch time. | The crystal eye. I wanna meet this dungeon.
  Maybe after lunch.| Eh, I'll skip lunch. Just catch up with me when you are finished.
  *Pfft* Yeah, right.| What?
  Without the aid of my magnificent powers...  ...Huh? Huh? You'd get killed down there.| Hey! I can do things without you! You wanna bet I can't?
  Nope. Come get your sandwich.  Listen to Jake, Finn. He only wants what's best for--  Ahh! Help me! Ahh! Come put her out of her misery, dude!| We are betting! I bet that I'll get that crystal eye and be back within 11 minutes.  Ready set go! 
  Oh, my... | Dungeons! Chambers! Woah.  Evil creatures!  Treasure chests! 
  Dungeons! Chambers! Woah.  Evil creatures!  Treasure chests! | Doorways!  Traps!  I'm in my elemeeeeeeeeent!! 
  Doorways!  Traps!  I'm in my elemeeeeeeeeent!! | Aww!
  Aww!|  Oh?
   Oh?| Whoa! Somebody come pick up your freaky cat.
  Greetings, Frank the Human Boy.| How did you almost know my name?!
  I have approximate knowledge of many things. For instance, I know that I am possibly going to slay you and munch on your eyeballs. | Huh, yeah right. That sounds like idiot talk!
  You're trespassing on my dungeon, manling. And I am the thing...  ...you should be afraid of.| You can't hurt me! I'm a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye!
  I'm going to unzip your skin and wear you like a little coat.| Unzip this! 
  Unzip this! | Bleep!  OOF!
  Wait a minute.  Is that dog smell?! You... you have a dog with you? I'm outta here! | Yeah, right! Good excuse! Slaps, that cat was kicking my buns! And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank. Dang it, Jake! I'll get that crystal eye on my own! With my own odors.  Hmm, no to skeletal remains door.  No to giant monster mouth door.  Oh! Giant key door it is!
  Yeah, right! Good excuse! Slaps, that cat was kicking my buns! And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank. Dang it, Jake! I'll get that crystal eye on my own! With my own odors.  Hmm, no to skeletal remains door.  No to giant monster mouth door.  Oh! Giant key door it is!| If Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it.  Yeah! Key hand!  Ouch!  Hey! What the jug is that?
  If Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it.  Yeah! Key hand!  Ouch!  Hey! What the jug is that?| Oh, sweet, the key!
  Halt! Come no further adventurer, for you see none can defeat... the Bucket Knight! | Okay, then I won't fight you.
  No! You must challenge me to-- | Hey cutie, do you know how to get to the crystal eye from here?
  Yes, it's through that door over there, but-- | Thanks!
  Hey! You can't pass through that door with out battling me!| Yes, I can. Because I'm huge compared to you.
   Just add water and...  ...exponential growth!| Aw, buckets.
  Now, activate thine own powers, and we shall engage in thrilling single combat!|  Heh, thing is... I don't really... have any powers.
   I see...| AAAAH!! Dang it, Jake wouldn't be running! He'd grow all big, and sock you right in the nose hole!  Aw, nutzoids!  Come on! All aboard the knuckle train to fist planet! 
  AAAAH!! Dang it, Jake wouldn't be running! He'd grow all big, and sock you right in the nose hole!  Aw, nutzoids!  Come on! All aboard the knuckle train to fist planet! | Oww... I rode the knuckle train? But... I... I'm in my element.
  Oww... I rode the knuckle train? But... I... I'm in my element.| AHHHHH!!!! Ow! OW! Ow! OW! Ow! Uhh! That... sucked.  Alright, Finn, you're in a heavy pickle here. You don't have Jake, and you're on your own. But you can still handle this. You can still get that crystal eye! 
"  Hey, my dinner is back. And your dog isn't with you! That's what you said, right? Jack the Dog is not ""accompanying"" you?"| You mean Jake?
  Jake, Jack, whatever. He's not here, which means I'm going to rip your heart out. | Crud, crud, crud, crud, crud!
  One... two... three!  Aw, man! I thought you'd be behind this rock. Hmm...  Alright. I know where you are now! And I'm about to pounce again!  One... two... three!  Aw, man! Well, there's only a few more places to look.| Oh, Jake... I'm such a fool. A silly, silly fool.  Who the heck--?!
  Hey, it's okay. Shh, I'm your guardian angel, Finn. I'm here to save you.| Re...really?
  Mmm-hm. Come here, let the angel pick you up.| Okay.  This is radical.
  Are you comfortable? Would you like some snacks?| I'm fine, thank you.
  Here, let me clean you up, and mend your clothes. | Ha ha ha ha ha!
  I'm taking you to the chamber of the Crystal Eye....|Aww, yeah!
  ... where I'm going to cook you and eat your flesh.| Wow... Wait! What??!
  Trust in your  guardian angel!| Put me down, lady!
  As you wish.| Man, everybody wants to eat me up. It's probably 'cause I'm so sweet.
  Now for little kid soup.  The secret is a low flame over a long period.| That's Jake's secret, too. I sure hope he saves me.
   I will save thee, Finn.| Lady, you are sick! Oh, Jake.
  What?| Jake!
  Finn!| What are you doing here?!
"   But you would have blown right through. I kept thinking to myself, ""What would Finn do?"" Just...eh, frustrating. Know what I mean?"| Yeah... I think I do. 
  Yeah... I think I do. | Now let's find a way out of this cage.
  I'll get us out with Key Hand! | I really don't see any key holes on this cage.
  Not a problem, man. Lock Hand!|  I'll get us out of here, with carrot hand!
  Alright, man. Let's go! We've still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet!| Wait! You'd help me win a bet that I made that I said I could accomplish something without you?
  Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy!| Cling!
  Alright, man. Let's give this crystal eye the old friendship lift.| Okay.
  Friendship, go!| If I die, I'll have died with my best friend!
   Looks like that's not the answer she wanted.| Uhh... I learned that you're a very... intelligent princess?
   Here's one called Caturday Surprise.| Throw it!
  Yeah, go on, get out of here!  Unless you feel like a fist cookie, you better keep runnin'!| What the heck is goin' on?
  I have no idea. But it's probably best to stay out of it.| Yeah. Hey, look.  This one looks stupid. Let's see how it flies!  Aw, lame. 
  Oh... | Oh no! She thinks that nuts guy did it. We gotta go clear up what happened!
  Don't worry, my dear. I'll have you fixed up in no time!| Princess!  Are you OK?
   Five days?! The Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty is tonight! | Uh... hey, Princess. There's something I should tell you about that bottle that hit you in the face.
  I already know, Finn! The Duke of Nuts has always been a bad guy. But now that he's done this, I'll never forgive him! And it's not just because I hate the Duke! I'd never forgive anybody who did this to me! I'd hate them!| Yeah but-
  FOREVER!|Forever?!
  Two witnesses!| Jake!
  Heheh. She's completely bonkers.| What do I do? If I tell her I threw it, she'll hate me forever!
  Don't worry!  That won't happen. We're gonna catch that Duke!| But we're the ones who threw the bottle!
  Dude, look. The Duke of Nuts is bad guys.| How do you know that?
  Think about it. If Bubblegum hates him so much, then he must have done some rotten stuff. I mean, maybe he even threw a bottle and turned someone ugly before.| Maybe you're right.
  Maybe I am!| Alright, just this once, we'll be vigilantes!
  Nah, we're more like cops. Crooked cops! | Princess! I won't rest until the villainous duke is captured!
   Oh, thank you, Finn! | Woah. Okay, and by then, hopefully you'll have taken care of...this. 
  Woah. Okay, and by then, hopefully you'll have taken care of...this. | Look yonder! The Duke of Nuts castle!
  Look yonder! The Duke of Nuts castle!| Duke of Nuts!
  How are you?| By order of Princess...
  By order of Princess...|  Um, Princess...  
  Hello, Finn. Are you here to arrest the Duke?| How did you know?
  I know of my husband's crime against the princess. A crime that you personally witnessed! And why would you lie? Huh?| Yeah, why?
 Oh but he was once such a wonderful man! He'd pet dogs, kissed babies; we'd lie together underneath the cashew bush. He even taught under-privileged nuts how to dance. But somehow he's gone rancid! These nuts tell me he must be executed. Would you like to hear what my nuts have to say?!| That won't be...um...necessary.
  Woah!| I don't get it, Jake. How can the dude be evil if he pets puppies, kisses babies, and lies with his wife?
  Why, Jake? Why won't you print my letters? I...I...I HATE YOU!| Hmm.   It's him! The Duke of Nuts!
  Hmm.   It's him! The Duke of Nuts!|  I'll break left! You take the right! 
  I went left too!| Wha-?  You're way smaller than I thought you were!
  Who's the toughest little nut? That's you.   One second.| Man, I don't know, Jake. Why would Princess Bubblegum hate him if he's such a nice guy?
  Just because he's a good father, doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a villain.| That doesn't look like a villain.
  I can probably think of a reason why that's villainous if you gave me enough time. Maybe.| Ugh! Maybe we should just confess. But then, Princess Bubblegum will hate us forever.
  Oh! Sorry to make you wait. I made these daisy crowns for you guys as a- as a token of gratitude for waiting.  Oh...sorry I....I have to sit down for a second. I know this is an odd question, but you wouldn't happen to have any pudding on you, would you?| Actually yeah, I think I have one in my pack.
  Oh, thank goodness.| I think I have a spoon in here too- wha-?
  Oh, I'm so embarrassed! Now you know my shame. I can't stop eating pudding.| What?!
  I don't tell people because I hate making them worry, but yes, I have a rare condition. A pudding deficiency. And I always end up eating all of the royal pudding supply whenever I go to the castle.| So that's why Princess Bubblegum hates you!
  Yes, but I didn't turn Princess Bubblegum green and bald! I would never do such a thing!| Gah! Of course you wouldn't! You're too nice a guy. I'm the one who threw that bottle. I was gonna tell her, but then-- she started talking all crazy-- she said she'd never forgive me and I-- I didn't know!
  Hey, it's okay. People make mistakes. It's all part of growing up and you never truly stop growing.| Now you're making me feel even worse by being so nice about it.
  Maybe I should just confess the crime and end all of this.| Wait...I think I might have an idea that will save everyone's reputations.
  Wait...I think I might have an idea that will save everyone's reputations.| Halt!
  Finn! Did you find the duke yet?| Not yet, but you are in grave danger, Princess. There is an assassin in these very woods, dead set on stopping you from reaching the Grand Meeting. In fact, what's that rustling in the bush??
   Rustle. Rustle, rustle.  I'm an ambush! Halt!| What's going on?!
  Oh,  Did I come out to early?|  What are you here to do, stranger?
  Um, guys?| Stand back! I will stop him! Hi-yah!
  I will kill you! And raise your children as my own!| Hi-yaah!
  Hah!| Remember, it's just acting, Jake!
   Yeah, alright!|  Yeah!
  Peppermint Butler! | Oh, no!
  Nuttin's going my way today.| No!
  Finn?| The duke didn't throw that bottle! Ahh- Princess, I have something sucky to confess. I'm the one who threw the bottle.  I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you, you'd hate me forever!
  Hmm...well, I could never stay mad at you forever. And you seem genuinely penitent.| I don't even know what that means, but thank you!
   But that doesn't douse my hatred for the duke!| Yeah, what's up with that hate?
  That jerk always empties out my pudding pantry!| Aw, shucks. He just can't control himself around pudding. He goes cocoa-nuts for it! Because he has a pudding deficiency!
  Oh, my, you poor man! Of course you're forgiven!  Yeah, I don't believe a word from him.|  I'm really sorry about making you temporarily ugly, Princess. Especially before the Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I wish there was some way to make it up to you.
  Maybe there is, Finn. Maybe there is... hey! |  Hmm, what? You said maybe.
   Call to order the sesquicentennial Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I now call upon the delegate from the Candy Kingdom. Princess Bubblegums?| Ahem! It would be presumptuous indeed to present myself against the distinguished princess to whom you have listened.
  Whoa!| Geez Louise, guy
  So you got any, kid? Food? | I got this little piece of sugar.  Nuts, I'm freaking all about sugar. But I am even more about feeding hobos! 
  Whoa, man. Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is wrong thing to do.| Why?
"  I don't know. I said ""Maybe"" "| A hero always helps someone in need and besides he's probably a secret elf who will reward us for being nice. Here you go, buddy. 
   Whoa!| Aw, yeah!
   Think happy thoughts… Little, cute, bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies.| what is wrong with you, Magic Man?!
  ...For you!| why did you do that!?
  Because on this day, a magical life lesson comes to you.| No! Change me back.
  What a nutty guy| What the heck, man?? What kind of deal is that? I help somebody out and they make me a stinky foot.
   You smell pretty good.|  Get off of me, man! I can't be a hero if I'm a big good-smelling foot!
  Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong. Now that you're a huge foot you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard. You're 100% kick, man!| Why are you being so level-headed about this?
  Don't be a siss, Finn. Here, c'mon kick my butt. | You're the SISS, siss! Augh! 
   Ouch! oooh! Ouch. See, man. Let's give your foot body a shot.|  No, dude! I wanna go find that magic man and get my body back!
  Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch!| This sucks, dude.
   Hahaha! What'd I tell you? You're a great hero! Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes.| No, Jake. Let's find that Magic Man.
  Town on fire! This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability!| But I-I can't even bend these big fat toes, man.
  You can do it, Finn. What'd I teach you, dude?|  Not to scorn the kicking of people in the crotch?
  You got it! Now I'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town  --only the babies.  Get your hero on, dude!| Aaahh!
  Aaahh!| Uhh. Okay, you can do this, Finn.  Start small, man. I'm taking you down! 
  Uhh. Okay, you can do this, Finn.  Start small, man. I'm taking you down! |  It's hot! Oh, man, I'm smoking hot! Please, help me out! I can't move!
  He probably started this fire!| No, I didn't start any –
  Get rid of the freak.  Freak! Freak!| Unh!  I'm not a freak, I'm a hero.
  Finn!| Jake, how'd you find me?
  Oh, I can sense when you're about to cry. It's like a mother/daughter thing.|  I'm not going to cry, man! I just feel like crying. We have to find that magic guy and  get my body back now!
  What we have to do is find out what reeks under this bridge | Jake!
  Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell.| Get back here!
  I am Gork, leader of Freak City. Ah, I can see one of you has felt the Magic Man's touch. | Yeah! You know that guy?
  Yo, Finn, this place is really bumming me out. Let's get out of here.| What?! No, dude. These guys might be my only hope of finding the Magic Man.
  Hey, we actually do have orange juice.| Thanks for being cool and all, but what do you know about this Magic Man? How do we catch him?
  Oh, he can't be caught. He's got magic and we're worthless freaks. We can't ever beat him. So we've gather here to wallow in our self-pity.| But don't y'all even want to try?
  Eh, no.| Why not? You're all totally miserable here.
  Ugh. It's a living.| No, it's not, Zap! It's not a living! It's dookie diapers! I don't want to be a foot!
   Awesome.  Here we go.| Jake, stop screwing around.  You're gonna make me give into depression.
   Eh, what are you going to do about it? Probably nothing, right? If you're depressed, you'll do nothing. | I…  Maybe I will do nothing.] Maybe I'll just lay down here.  Lay down –uh —and rot like the rest of you.
   Yeah!  Stay a foot! Stay a foot! Stay a foot!|  ♫ Is this really my life?
  Huh? Why?| ♪ I'm not gonna let you lie here,
  Whoa. Okay man, just be cool.| ♫ And I'm not gonna be cool!
  Hey, Finn.| ♫ Ja-a-a-ke, stop tellin' me to enjoy, bein' a foot, and get out of that trash! ♫
  Heh heh. I can't take you seriously when you're singing, man.| Get up!
  Ahh!| ♫All of you make me sick!
  Hey, stop it, man!  We don't like touching each other.| Huh?
  Please, man.| Wait a second. Kim, get underneath Trudy.
  No, man. Please. I freakin' hate Trudy.|  Kim, I will destroy you!
  Yeah, do it, Kim.| Yes! Now for me  Look at us!
  Oh, Finn, thank you.| Word! Now let's go wreck up that Magic Man!
  Are you sure about that?| You're darn right we are!
  You're darn right we are!| Give us our bodies back!
  Why should I? You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want.| Oh. You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything return. I should've given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward.
  Wrong! | Ah, geez!
   Finn!|  You've gifted us nothing but heartache, Magic Man! What is the life lesson in that?!
   Yes, my children, you are so close to the answer.| Answer this!
  Get his eyes! Cut him in the eyes!| I wish I'd never been nice to you 'cause you're just a big jerk!
  Oh, yes, that's it!  You've finally learned your lesson.  And now I'm off spread my teachings to more sissy do-gooders.  You're welcome!| Man, I frickin' hate that guy. But at least now we can all go back to our regular lives.
  Bye, Finn! Thank you!| Oh, okay. Bye, guys. See you, later.  Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned?
   Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks.| Speaking of jerks, what the blubbins, man?! Why wouldn't you help me turn back into a boy?!
  Well, because I kind of always wanted | What?
   I said, I kind of always wanted to be a foot myself.| You could be a foot right now. I saw you change into a foot twice yesterday.
  Safety!  Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety— Oh... Were we not wearing the uniforms?| C'mon. Let's keep lookin' for hazards. Look out!
  What is it, dude?| Shushers, man!  Look there!
  Just looks like an ordinary little town, man.| Yeah...  Suspiciously ordinary. Oh! Little house people! Maybe it is just regular ordinary, not sinister ordinary—oh, no, wait... Grass ogre.
  Haha!  Hey, chicken, you're travelin' egg-spress! | It's an obnoxious grass ogre.
  You're under arrest!  Good... Now get in your tiny cell... Oh, uh, oh!| Hey, ogre! Stop hazing these cute little houses!
  My name is Donny, idiot!| Sorry. I was just tryina' get your attention.
  Hahaha! I'm gonna mess with these housies some more.| NEVER!!
   Whoa.| You're doin' it wrong!
  Whaddaya mean?| First, you roll your right shoulder forward...
  Like this?| Yeah, but then I counter it by doin' this! 
  Hey!| Um... You need to take a break?
  Whoa, I zoned out there for a bit. Did you win?| Nah. Just takin' five. Donny's pretty good.
  Yeah, well, you're okay, too.| Thanks, man.
  ...For a complete idiot!| Aww...
  Donny is one mixed-up dude.| Nah. He's just rough-and-tumble, like me, but deep down, he's probably really sensitive, like me.
  You're a mixed-up dude, too!| Hey, Donny!
  What?| I was thinkin' that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd wanna hang out with a couple a' rascals like me and Jake!
   You sure this is a good idea?|  If you come to the Tree Fort, we got video games and apple juice!
   Really?!  I mean... if it keeps you from cryin'...|  Donny's problem is that he's treated like an outsider, like me.
  You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts!| I... am complicated.
  Uh... This fort isn't so great. Not as cool as the fort I'm gonna build.  I call this chair!| Hey, Donny, you should play Bug Battle.
  I have pants...  spun from spiderwebs... by pixies.|  Okay. There's you, and here come the bugs.
  Huh?!| Oh, yeah. Those guys'll get ya.
  Not cool, dude.| Have more apple juice. It always makes me feel better when I—  Aaah! Donny! Quit being a jerk!
  Everybody's gettin' mad at me for nothin'!| You have to think about how your actions make other people feel.
  Ooh! Teach him that little empathy song I taught you!| Okay, yeah!  Empathy, empathy, put yourself in the place of me!  Your turn!
  Uh... Empathy, empathy, put yourself... Ohh! So it's like, when I squeeze eggs outta chickens, I should let them squeeze eggs outta me, too!| ...Um... kinda right.  Someone needs our help! Jake, you stay here and try to fix him, while I deal with an unknown possibly deadly emergency! 
  Quick! Act abandoned!| Hands off the housing market!  BACKPACK!  Werewolves. Much worse than ogres. 
  Stop in the name of the law!| Is there somewhere I can trap that thing?
  I'm not old!| Perfect!  Slam-bam-in-a-can! Huh? Another werewolf?!? What's up with this town?!
  Perfect!  Slam-bam-in-a-can! Huh? Another werewolf?!? What's up with this town?!| Mr. Bank! Are you alright?!
  Oh, it's fine, it's fine. All my assets are insured. Pardon.  I have to go spackle my cracks.|  Why is this town just getting worse and worse?
   Yes! Why indeed!!|  Hey! What are you werewolves up to?!
  We're not werewolves...   We're Why-wolves.| Uh... Why-wolves?
  Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry.....  AND... BLOODLUST!!| What?!
   Please. Save your questions until the end of the lecture.  Our ecosystem. At the bottom level are the house people. Given the opportunity, we Why-wolves would easily wipe them out. However, Donny's presence is a natural deterrent. His jerkiness is so powerful that it produces a pungent gas—obnoxygen. To Why-wolves, it is a deadly poison. But since you've removed the jerk Donny, we will devour the houses, and our population will rapidly swell until we are, in turn, devoured by the Cosmic Owl. Such is the course of nature, but it'll be a pretty sweet ride up until that point.  TONIGHT, WE FEAST ON THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS! | Oh, no! I have to get Donny back!
  Oh, no! I have to get Donny back!|  Donny, you have to go right now, and stop the Why-wolves from—
   Ah! Master Finn has returned!| What's it goin'?!
  Thanks to you, I shall never be jerky again!| Oh, no... Oh, no. Oh, no, nonononononono! No! This is all wrong! We need jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen, and, and—
  Steady on, Finn. Perhaps you are dehydrated! It's as Jake taught me| Are you wearing jeans now?!
  Surely!  Gotta get pants! Go get your pants! Button, fly! I wrote that one myself. Perdoname. | But, but, but—
  Butt, butt, butt! Yeah, Donny! You're lookin' good in those jeans!| What did you do?!
  Miraculous, isn't it? I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect.| No! We messed up, Jake! The House People are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk!
   I have no intention of being a jerk again. Hmph.| But the housies will be wiped out if you don't!
  It sounds tragic, but I'm turning over a new leaf! | Donny, you gotta go!
"  Finn, ""no"" means, ""no."" I'm sure you'll respect my wishes.  No! Stop! No!"| Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves!
  No! I'll use my musical messages to stop them!  Let's see... I've got one on the ethics of laundry... Crosswalk-ery... Ooh! Here's a good one!| Man! The town is getting creamed! By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny!!
   Comb your hair right! It's a good time! Sticky, sticky pomades, short back and sides!   Why isn't anybody paying attention to my words?|  He sure is sensitive about his songs!   It's cuz they think your songs are dumb!
   What're you saying?! If you don't encourage his talent, he might revert back to jerk Do—  OHHH, OHHH!  HEY, DONNY! EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!!| They all think you're a real jerk!
  Get offa' me, nerds!!| You did it, Donny! You're a full-blown jerk again!
  What?! You're the jerk!! Housies! Ready to hear my new song?! It's about how Finn will betray you, just to save lives!|  I'm sorry, Donny.
   C'mon. We can go stare wistfully at the lake.|  I'd... I'd like that. Very much.
  Yeah!|  Whoo-hoo!!
  Hmm...| Awesome!  Someone needs our help!
  Oh, come on!|  Dude! It's Marceline the Vampire Queen!
"  ""Henchman for life"" means, ""henchman for life!!"""|  You still petrified of vampires?
  Okay. I don't want to cry, but I shall cry for you. |  Hey! Cut that out!
  Oh! If it isn't my favorite little goodie-two-shoes Finn!| Stop making this poor old dude cry!
  I can make him do whatever I want. Watch. Henchman, amuse me.| Stop it!
  Now hop around in a circle.| Oh, no. Don't worry, sir. I'll see to it you get set free.
  Oh, and how're ya gonna pull that off, hero?| I'll do what I need to. I'll even take his place!
  Do you mean it?| Uh... well...  Heck yeah!
  EEH! | I couldn't watch that old man suffer, Jake. My code of honor wouldn't allow it.
  AAAH!  I wanna help you outta this, man, but... she scares the filling out of my doughnut. Let's just leave.| I can't. As a hero, I'm bound by my  WOOOOORD!!
  You're lucky, Finn. Your first job as henchman is to help me feed.|  Feed?! What does she mean? L-Like, like, oats? Like, sentient beings, or oats?! It doesn't matter! I can handle it!
  Sounds like dinner. Finn, open the door.  OPEN IT ALREADY!| No way, Marceline! I'm not gonna open this door if innocent people will be hurt!
  Aren't you bound by your word to do as I say, hero?| I...  Yes... 
  Huh?| Sorry about this.
  Hold him down!  Are you enjoying this, Finn?| No!
  Please, human boy! Let me go!| I'm sorry, sir. I'm bound by my code of honor to do what she says.
  I understand, son. I was married myself once. | Wait, wait! I'm not married to—
   Ugh! Enough talking! Dinner is served!| No!  No! 
  How dare you, henchman?! I order you to let me feed!| NOOOOO!!!
  Mmm. That red bow tie was delicious!|  Huh? 
  What's wrong, Finn?| I... I thought you were—
  Oh, my! A white tie! Thank you so much! This is so beautiful! | B-but...
  What? You know I eat the color red sometimes. | Oh... Yeah... Okay...
  We've got plenty more evil to do! |  Man... What's wrong with this girl? I can't tell if she's messin' with me, or... or what.
  Hey, Finn. You thinkin' about how that guy's bow tie sorta looked like a bra?| Huh? No!
  I know this place seems a little dead, but don't worry. It'll soon be undead.  Corpses buries in mud that's black, from death I command you to come back!  Hahaha! Are you ready to lead an evil army of the undead?!| Uhh, NEVER!  Okay! I'll do it!
  Excited to hear the wild screams of an entire castle?|  Haha, aw, yeah, that sounds bombastic, honey! Hey, I'm gonna run up ahead and scout it out for you, sugar! 
  Yeeees? Duke and Duchess of Nuts' residence!| My boss is gonna sack your castle!
  Why would you want to sack my nut castle on my second son's first birthday?! SEIZE HIM!| No!  Listen! You hear that?! My master is marching here with her army of the undead!
  Oh! How wonderful!| Listen to me!!  EVERYBODY!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!
  Hahaha!  I wrote this next song about a fisherman. | Don't do this, Marceline! I beg you!
  You're late, Marceline! My son has been dying to hear your undead music!| Wha?!
  Oh, I forgot! Marceline is playing tonight!| Okay... So, she makes things seem bad, a-and then... or-or her personality makes them seem bad, or...  I'm over-reacting.
  Hey!| Huh?
  Why are you thinking so hard?! Just party hard! Whoo!| Alright! Whoo-hoo! Hahahaha!
  Hey, castle-crasher!| Hey, Marceline!
  You like cute things, right?| Uh, yeah, sure. Why?
  Then you might love this. The cutest dimple plant ever!| Whoa-ho-ho! That's cool!
  Here, eat some of its fruit. See what happens.|  Hahaha! A dimple!
  Okay, henchman, now... I need you to do something.| What is it?
  I want you to take this dimple plant outside, and kill it!| What?!
   Use my ax bass.| I'm gonna murder you. I'm not entirely sure why. I'm sure this will end happy...  AAH! I don't get it! There's always a twist to the stuff Marceline makes me do, but where's the twist in bumping off this bush?!
   There is no twist. Kill it now!| But wh—
  You should've hacked it to pieces when it was still adorable...| I-I thought—  Sick!!
  Oh, boy...  Not bad... for a henchman.|  Hmm...
   Hmm...| Hey. Can't the sun, like, destroy you?
  Yeah, it hurts, but I kinda like it. Reminds me of when I'd scrape my knees up as a kid, and my mom would patch me up... you know what I'm sayin'?| Uh... Jake told me I came out of a cabbage.
  Hey, Finn, I need you to strangle some pixies.| Yeah, sure. That sounds good.
  Whoa, why are you being so casual about that? Strangling pixies is some hardcore evil.| I'm not fallin' for your junk anymore, lady! You just like sayin' poop that jacks with my brain!
   What are you talking about? I...  Dang, man, I didn't think you'd ever catch on!|  I knew it! Hey... what about your old henchman? Who was that guy?
  Oh, just an old diving buddy.   So, you ready to go strangle some pixies?| Yeah, man! I mean, wo-man.
   Oh, no! My buddy is totally under her vampire spell!  Die, unholy thing! | Jake?
   Ow! | Marceline!
  I'm stakin' that vampire and settin' you free, no matter how terrified I am!| She's alright, man!
  She's still controlling your mind with evil! Now, back off and let me vanquish her from existence!| I can't let you do that, Jake!
   I love you, brother. YAAAH! | Jake, listen! Marceline is not how she seems! She's a radical dame who likes to play games!
  What are you even talkin' about, dude?!| Oh, man! 
  MARCELINE!  Where is she?!|  I-I'm free! Jake! You faced your fear and saved me!
   Is it cool?| Yup!
  Finn, I owe you big-time! Changing into a bat and hiding in your pack was genius!| That's what henchmen are for.
  Oh, uh, that reminds me. You're fired from your henchman-ship. It's no fun when I can't trick you.| We're still on for pixie-strangling tomorrow, though, right?
   Heh heh.  Aw, yeah. | Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls.  Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure!
  Whoa, really?!| Yeah, man!!  I wrote on my arm this to-do list of cool junk.  Number one
   Hmmm...  Finn... it's a knife storm!!  It's raining knives, man! Come on! | I've never seen a knife storm before... It's beautiful.
  Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid.| Well, what're we gonna do?
  I've created a new game called Conversation Parade.| Hah! Alright!
   What do you think about the stars in the sky?| 'S okay, I guess.
  That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn...| Booooo.
  BMO, that was weak.| What now?
  Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!| Whoa! What?!
  Let's use our imaginations, man!| Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that.
  Eh. Your loss.  AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!!  Lava on the floor!| Shut up, man...
  Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!| I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality. 
  NOOOOO!!|  AAAAH!!!  Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!
  I was just playin' around with my imagination...  ...and then everything got intense.| It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!
   Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...| Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries.
  WHOA!| But first stop imagining lava!
  I can't! My imagination's too amazing!| Imagine turning your imagination off!
  I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters.| Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?
  You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!| Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!
  Neat!  Grab that missile.| Okay.
  And... get that cosmic gauntlet.| Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH!  What did I just hit?!
  I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.| Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?
  Oh, there's one now.  Look out!| Aah! I can feel it on my foot!  I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!
  You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!| Yah, yah! 
  Alright! You're gettin' him, man!  Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family.  Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face!  She's comin' back for revenge.| Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!
  The knife storm, remember?!?!  Oh, boy... Ooh... Finn, I found some candy.  It tastes like banana candy, man.  Here, man. Try some.|  Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.
  Okay!  It is done.|  Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!
  No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle.|  An imaginary riddle master?
   An imaginary riddle master?|  Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test.
  Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land.|  LAY IT ON ME!!
  I can't imagine a riddle.| Dude, just make it super easy.
  THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle?| Man, that riddle sucks.
  THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!!| YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!
  You exploded the snakes right at us!!| I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!
  I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!| Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!
 AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!!  Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck!  The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!| Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!
  Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!| Don't you do it...
  Don't you do it...| DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!
  YEAH!| AW, YEAH!
  AW, YEAH!| Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me.
  Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed.| Is it clear?
  Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you.| Oh! I found the shut-off lever!
  Cool, man!  Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby.  What're you laughin' at?| Alright. I'm gonna turn it off.  UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!
  Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!| What?! Well, how do I kill it?! 
  I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this!  Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!| Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!!  Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake?  Hey, come on. Wake up, man.
   Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy.| Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?
  I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.| Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!
  But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you.| Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing. 
  Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing. | Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note.
  One note is all that is needed.|  I'm gonna turn your imagination back on.  Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!
  True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?| I remembereth.
  I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.| No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now...  ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go...  What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad.  Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!
  No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now...  ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go...  What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad.  Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!|  Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something.  Now for that switch.
   Good morrow, sir! My name is Bellamy Bug! Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy.| No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!
   I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!| REPRESENT THIS!  And this. 
  Oh! I say! Oh! Ah! Ouch! Ah!| Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright.  I hope this works, Jake!  Haha, yeah!  Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button! 
   Aaaah!! I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!|  Take a hike, fairy! Normal style! 
   Aw, man... I imagined my mom naked!  Yugh!| You okay?
  I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure!| I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here...  with... lava on the floor!
  Huh?!  AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding. | Hahahaha! Good dog. 
  AAAAH!| Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen!
  NEVER!!| Huh?  Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er!
  Aaaah! Oof!| My inflatable angel.
  Heh heh heh.  How's the Mini Queen?| I dunno. Can't understand a word she says.  Aww! My pleasure, ma'am! I just like beating up evil!  Okay... Didn't... catch any of that either.
   Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky.  No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way!  Whoa!| What?
   Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy!| Billy?!
  Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear!| This is so cool!
  Whoa!| It's Billy's legendary crack!
   Hello.|  It's him! It's him!!
  Yep. It's me.| Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!
  What for?| So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!
  Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch!  Ah... ah...|" What do you mean, ""pointless?"" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!"
  Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.| Nonviolently??  I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...
  Me, too!| Billy, I won't let you down!
  I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy!| This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct.
  Help! Help!  A monster!  Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible Dragon! Please, please help!| Oh, uh...
  No, but please! |  Dude. We gotta do something to help him.
  I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz.|  Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?
  AAAH!! NO!! HELP!!| I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon.
   What's this all about?| Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure!
  Hahaha!  I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate.|  YEAH!!!
   YEAH!!!| This is great, Jake!
  Yeah, we're really helpin' people!| Whoa! Look who it is!
  Oh, thank you!  Hahahaha! Hahaha.  AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!| Huh?  Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor.
  AAAAH!! MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!!|  Geez... I thought people would like that.
  Why?! Why would anyone want that?!| So you can defend against evil monsters!
  You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!| No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!
  Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!| Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?
  WHAT?! NO—| Alright! We're cobblers!
"   What does ""cobble"" mean, anyway?"| I think it has something to do with shoes...
   Excuse me! Can you help me? I need a broken heel fixed. I'm going to a fancy funeral.|  Of course I'll help!
   Of course I'll help!| There!  Whah!  Pa-kow!!
  Ah!| Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!
   Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?| Maybe...  Whoa!
   GET OUT!!| Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent.
"  Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're ""sucking"" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!"|"  Totes. I'll stop ""pooping"" my diaper."
  HELP! I NEED MEDICAL HELP!!| Medical help? Hmmmmm...
  Medical help? Hmmmmm...| How can we help?
  I want surgery to make my body hot.| Yikes...
  Dude, did you use a magic nail again?| I've got three left!
  Ohhhh...  What did you do to me??| We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right?
  Huh?!| ...Jake...?
  ....Yeah...?| I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out...
  Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive!| I just wanna sit here and moan.
  Then I'll moan with ya, buddy.|  Thaaaanks, buuuddy...
  Oooh!! Aaah!!| Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm...
   Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!?|  WRONG!!!!   I couldn't think of anything...
  Whooo! | POOP!! I saved her with violence...
  What's your huff, son?| The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down.
  Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out! And you did it with violence! Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures!  Just like I was born to be an old lady! Don't deny your rowdy nature, paladins!  And don't take advice from old people! | Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point!
  Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo—| It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!!
  Cha!!| It's us again.
  Aw, I don't—I don't wanna buy anything.| Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns.
  Hello!| We saved 'er, Billy.
  You saved 'er.| I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these!  And look how happy she is, man! She's elated!
 Ow! Hey! Don't touch us! OWWWW!| Jake! Jake!  Jake?  Hmmm... 
  Aaaah!  Aaaaah!  Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl!  Uh! That sounded horrible, man! |I don't know how to play.
 Exactly! |Huh? Let's go! 
 Oh, wait up. I gotta finish tuning my viola.|Soft People! Why are you all in a tizzy?
 The Gut Grinder! He's back!|"The ""Gut Grinder?"""
 Yes, the Gut Grinder is a gold-eating monster. In the past, the Soft People of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it. It was awesome ! But then, the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold. So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup. And it worked! The Gut Grinder didn't come back! But recently, and admittedly it was probably a bad idea, we took our gold out from under the cup and we put it in the center of town. Haha, 'cause--'cause we really like dancing around it! But, boy oh boy, was that a mistake. You know what happened?|Uhhh... it came back and ate all your gold?
  Yes, oh, yes!|Aw, don't cry, Soft Old Man. I'll find this monster and bring peace to this village. I swear!
 Swear to what?|I swear to justice!
 Whoa! He swears to justice!|Okay, so, what does he look like?
 I'm so scared, I'm gonna go wee-wee!|Whoa, no, no-no-no-no! Calm down, everybody. This is my friend, Jake the Dog.
 I'm gonna wee-wee! | That guy wee-wees weird.
 Huh? Oh, heheh. |Pfft.
 What?!|I didn't say anything.  People of the village of Soft People, I, Finn, and my buddy Jake, will find this monstrous monster and slay it!
 I didn't say anything.  People of the village of Soft People, I, Finn, and my buddy Jake, will find this monstrous monster and slay it!|Come on, let's go, Jake.
 Hey Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well. Hm, what if I really am the Gut Grinder? |Dude, your paws'll fit anything.
  That is true. Check this out.  I'm Finn the Human and I stink at viola!| I'm Jake the Dog and I put my nose in poop.
 There's a lot of interesting smells in poop.|Huh? 
 Huh? |Hey Cube People, what's going on here?
 Aaah! The Gut Grinder!|Whoa, no, no, no! He's not the Gut Grinder! He's my friend!
  Th-that's ridiculous.|Jake, back to your normal size.
 I'm not cute! I'm--mnh,  ooh.|We are also seeking the Gut Grinder. Me and my friend Jake will find it and slay it! Tell us what he looked like.
  Ruff, ruff, grrrr... |Huh... Which way did he go?
 Huh... Which way did he go?|Jake! Hey, come on!
 Wha--?  Where am I?| Thanks, guys!
 Finn...? What if I am the Gut Grinder?|What?!
 What if I'm, like, stealing gold in my sleep?|You can't be stealing gold in your sleep--I watch you while you sleep.
 Wha--? Yo, Finn, that is creepy, man.|I can't help it. I take pictures.
 Well, when do you sleep?|Justice never sleeps.
 Well, there's gotta be a time when you're not watchin' me... that--that I--that I might be stealin' gold unconsciously!| You... are... not... the... Gut... Grinder!
 City in danger! City in danger!|Let's go! Oh, wait--what if these guys think you're the Gut Grinder? Hmm...  Ah-ha!  Got the perfect thing for ya
 I love it!  Launch in 3, 2, 1! |Woohoo! Yeah!
 Woohoo! Yeah!|Oh, man! These people are a mess!
 Halt! Identify yourselves immediately!|I am Finn the hero!
  I'm Groucho!|We're on a mission to catch the Gut Grinder.
 I am the mayor of this village. Our gold has just been stolen by the very monster you speak of.|I hereby vow to catch that thief and bring your gold back!
 Our people thank you. I present to you this photo  of the Gut Grinder to help in your mission.| Oh, thanks.
  Wha--?  Finn, it's me!| Well, duh, it looks like you.  We already knew that. It's just one of those weird coincidences--like how my belly button looks like your face.
 Yeah, I-I know you think it does, Finn--but this is different. I'm scared, Finn. |Jake, stop it!
 Wha--? Oh, it's the Gut Grinder!|No, no-no-no-no! He's not the Gut Grinder! I swear on my good name... and justice... and Jake's cute face!
 His face is weird. The truth is obvious|NOOOOOO!
  You are under arrest for stealing our gold.| I'll get you out of here... somehow.
 No, Finn... I belong behind bars. Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder.|Buddy, listen to me. You've been my best friend for as long as I can remember! That's enough evidence to prove to me that you're not a monster!
 I'm in jail and I'm not the Gut Grinder.  I'm here for the free grub.  Hehehehehe! |Huh? Wait, I got an idea!
 Huh? Wait, I got an idea!|Hey, Gut Grinder! I got some gold here that you missed. Come and get it!
 Hey, Gut Grinder! I got some gold here that you missed. Come and get it!|Huh. Whoa, you're the Gut Grinder?
 Huh? Grrrr... not cute.  Am I the Gut Grinder?  All the clues fit!  I must be the Gut Grinder!  And I want GOLD!| Woohoo! Yeah! We got him! Thanks for saving me, Jake!
  Grrrr! I'm not Jake--I'm the Gut Grinder! Now give me that gold tooth!|What? Jake?  Whoa!
 What? Jake?  Whoa!| Whoa!
  Rawr! Now give me that tooth!|If I give you this stupid tooth, will you stop being a crazy jerk?!
 |"What the--? Jake! You never turn into a monster when I want you to. It's always, ""Not now, Finn. I have a headache."" Oh, Jake,  your viola is all I have now. "
  Huh?  Ah, stay away from my viola!|Jake, you remember your viola!
  I also remember that you stink hard at playing it. And dookie is radical, man! I don't care what anyone says.  Wha--huh? What? Where am I? Finn, is that you?|Who else would it be, baby?
 Whoo!  I guess I went nuts.|You were so crazy, man! Like--like, actually crazy.
 | It's good to have you back.
 It's good to have you pat my back.| Man, if I had known you were so easily manipulated, I would have eaten more of your ice cream.
 You have been a naughty girl, Sharon.  Guards! Throw my wife in jail.  Finn and Jake, thank you for saving my Spiky Village.| No problem, mayor.
 Now give us a hug.|No, don't do that! Don't hug us!  Don't touch me! AAAAAAAAAH!
  Thanks for helping me record, Finn.| No problem, Marceline.
  Now, I'm gonna sing something really personal, so don't laugh at me.| I would never dream of it... m'lady. 
  Now, start a slow beat, and keep it steady, or it'll mess up everything.| You got it!
  Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up!| Marceline, if you're thinkin' about your dad so much, then... why don't you go see 'im?
   He's not worth the effort.| Not worth what effort?
  Well... first, I'd have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then... uh... douse it with bug milk.|  Oh, yeah?! 
"   And then you're supposed to chant something like , ""Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum.""  But... I-I don't really wanna see him. I'm still mad about the thing with the fries.  Huh?!"| Wwwwhhhat?!  Whoa... whoa!! Aaagh!!
  Finn... what the heck did you do?!| I... reunited you with your family?
  Is this kid your evil servant?| I'm not evil, Marceline's dad. I'm super good!
"  ""Super good?"" "|  What're you doing?!
  Okay, I'll go. I've got business to attend to, anyway—sucking up all the souls in Oooooo...|  WHA—Gh—NO!!
  My bass!| I've unleashed evil onto Ooo ! We've gotta stop 'im, Marceline!
  Fine... but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back.| Hey! How do I kill this guy, anyway?
  Finn! You can't kill my dad!| Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean—
  No! You literally can't kill my dad! He's deathless!| Oh...
  So... This next part will be all the more... horrifying. | There!! Below us! A gathering of Fluffy People! May-haps they've seen your father! Marceline... release the Finn-bomb!  They're all freaked out!
  It's because they're scared of him.  Hm. My dad's been here. Come on. Let's go.| No! We gotta help this guy. I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me. You like, uh, collard greens or country-fried steak?
  Look. You wanna help him? Help me get my bass back.| How will that help hi—?
  MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!! And when I get it back... I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!| Oh, clam! But first you gotta return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad, little husks. Right, Marceline?
  Red Rock Pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains, he'll have to come through here.| We can work together! And smash 'im with this rock! And once he's smooshed, all the souls will go back to their rightful bods.
   Karate kick!! | Marceline!! Keep 'im right there!! HrrrrRAAAAGH!!!
  You're not even alive!| You blew it, dude. We're supposed to be a team—a team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin'-souls... ball.
  YES!!| Aw, man! He's growing huge!
  Aw, man! He's growing huge!| I'm gonna take 'im down!
  Finn, you're like an ant to him.| Oh, yeah? Well, this ant's about to get in his pants!
   What?|  You know!  Because I'm going to make him uncomfortable while I release those souls! RAAAAAAAAGH!!!  Give up those souls, Marceline's dad! In the name of justice!!
   No, Marceline.|  NO ONE FLICKS ME IN THE BUTT WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!!  Whoooaa!!  The souls... Lumpy Space Princess! He got your soul, too?!
"  What? Nah. I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here, and I wasn't invited?! I was all, ""What the lump?"" so I'm crashin' this party!"| Well, I'll save you... I'LL SAVE ALL OF YOU!!
  Well... you don't respect anything! Dad!! DAD!! I'm outta here!| BUT—!!
  Fine!! Go!! I'm too busy sucking to deal with you!| NO, WAIT! Marceline!! Keep talking to 'im! When he's talking, he can't steal souls!!
  I said I'm outta here!|  Diversion... need... diversion. 
   Oh, Marceline, I am so—|  YALALALALALALALALALALALALA!!!!!
   YALALALALALALALALALALALALA!!!!!| MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM!!   I'll see you in the Nightosphere, ya sick freak.  YES!!!!
  Finn!! How could you do that?!| How could I... save the day?
  How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?!| How could I embarrass-save you??  WHOA! Marceline!
   I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere. That was emotionally exhausting.| I'm also exhausted emotionally. Or... wait. I mean, I mean physically.
  I've been meaning to ask you... What's with that pocket on your shirt?| Oh, Jake's in here. 'Sup, Jake?
   Dude, we've been up for like seven days.|  For real-sies?
  Yeah, for real-sies!  Remember? First, we rescued the Slime Princess from the Ghost Ship Vortex. And then we slayed that fire dragon. And that took a couple of days.| Then we went to LSP's quinceañera.
  I swear that I found it like this. I don't know what happened.| We'll take care of it, Peppermint Butler.
  We've had a busy week.| I'm exhausted. But happy!
  Good night, buddy.| Good night!  That's right, Finn. Adventure 'til you drop.  Hey, Jake?
  Yeah?| Can you sleep?
  No.| I can't sleep either.
  Yeah, what's going on with that?| I don't know. But, I've got the strangest feeling...that we're being watched.
  I don't know. But, I've got the strangest feeling...that we're being watched.| Why is that horse staring at us?
  Why is that horse staring at us?| That's super creepy.
  Man, I just wanna go to sleep.| Well, maybe he's gone.
  Not gonna be able to sleep with that horse watchin' me.| Let's just close the shade.
 Outta sight and outta mind.| Good work, Jake
  All right, man. Let's just go...push it off that hill or something.| Maybe we can just...politely ask it to leave.
  Hey! Get out of here, horse! I want to go to sleep, and you're creeping me the math out!| Whoa, man! Let me try, diplomat style.  Pardon me horse, I beseech thou to split from mine land, this night. But I welcome thee to come back for some luncheth, some other day. Okay?
  Forget it, man. This horse is whack. It's got poo-brain.|  Okay, you're right. We can try pushing it, now.
   Okay, you're right. We can try pushing it, now.| Move, horsey! Good Grod, Jake! Are you even pulling?!
  I'm super-pulling!| This horse has a ridiculous weight!
  This horse has a ridiculous weight!| Math this. What now, man.
  RAAAAHH! AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!| You shouldn't creep us out from way over there!
  Let's get back to bed, buddy.| Oh yeah, I'm so ready for bed.
  I wanna marry my bed.| Me too!
  No more.... NO MORE!| Where are you going?!
  I have an idea!  I did it! Ha-ha! He can't stare at us if he's blind!| Look, man. 
  Wh..why?! Stupid blindfold! What's your deal, screwy?! Why are you messin' with us, huh?!| Jake! That horse is whack with poo-brain.
  Yeah, I know, Finn. I diagnosed this horse with whacked out poo-brain five minutes ago.| Dude, poo-brain means we can lure it away from here using music.  Everything brainless likes music.
  That's true! You're a genius!  All right horse, prepare to be lured!  Follow me, Horsey.| Jake? It's not luring!
  Huh! Hmmm.  So, Beet-hoven's not luring enough for you, is it? Well, how about some Mozzart?! | Huh?!
  Huh?!| Ha! 
  Ha! | Stop! You're luring snakes! STOP!!
  Huh? Oh, nuts. Let me try and lure a mongoose! | Stop man!
  No! Ahh!  Dude... let's kill the horse.| What?!
  I'm so tired, Finn!| No, man, we're not killing the horse.
  Okay, we won't kill the horse. We'll dress him up like a bunny! Ha-ha! And get a giant hawk—Caaaww!--To kill him!| Wah?!
  Caaawww! Caaawwwwww!| No, man! That is wrong.
  Eh. Did I say that the hawk would kill him? I meant that the hawk would swoop down gently and take him away to an island of sunshine and love-stuff and, take care of him.| Whoa. That sounds awesome.
  What do think?| It looks like a bunny?
  Hey Come and get it hawk, let's go!| Hey Jake, I think I see a hawk or two.  Cause more commotion to help the hawks!
  Ahhh! Blblblblblblblblblbl!  Take the bunny!| Hey, there they are! They see our commotions!
  Grab a good hold and fly away!| The bunny! The bunny!
  The bunny! The bunny!| What a beautiful sight.
  | Good night, buddy.
  Good night, buddy.| Ahh! It's in our house now!
  That's obvious, Finn! You don't have to say that out loud!| Hey, this is all your fault, dude! If you weren't so darn handsome, animals wouldn't always be staring at you!
  You're just mad at me for being...handsome? Well, you're the one who told me to lure snakes! Ahhh!| I told you to lure the horse! You lured the snakes! There's even one here in my underpants!  Wait a minute, dude. Can't you see what this horse is doing?  It's tearing us apart.
  Aw, man.. you're right! We have to get rid of this horse, for us!| I know, bro. I know. 
  Oh, Finn; this horse is bringing us together now. This horse is a blessing.| What?! Dude, you've lost it!
  You...wait, wait.  The horse is tearing us apart again!| You're right! It's about time I show this horse who's the man.
  What are you going to do?| Say that to me again.
  What are you going to do?!| Do... Doo-doo. I'm going to kick that horse in the bottom!
 Other| You were spying on us?!
  He was trying to learn our bedtime secrets!|  Were you?
  Here's your sword, dude!| Thank you.
  Thank you.| Jake! Jake! Look out!
 Other| Snakes!
  Quick! Throw them to the Ice King!| What's he doing?
 Other| Yeeesss!
 Other| We don't need any more.
 Other| Guests bring their own ice.
  Guests bring their own ice.| Tell us why you're watchin' us or we'll - we'll cut off your stupid head.
 Other| What?
  Why does she keep saying that?| I think she's traumatized, dude.
   Have you guys...  seen the new...  nice king?| Nice King?
   Yeah!  He's single...  and he's ours!  Now, get out of our way! | 
  Man, now we have to kick that frog out of his new home.| Nah, let him keep it. Hey, there's a new king and he's nice, we should offer our services!
   Huh? | You're the nice king, right?
 Other| Well, we will honor and serve you.
 Other| Yeah! We wanna be your nice knights.
  Yeeah! We're knights! Niiice...| Who do you want us to nice knight against?
 Other| W-well, what do you mean?
 Other| Managing admirers? We'll give it a try...
  | Are you fond of men with magical abilities?
  I think we did a good job.| I don't feel good making a princess cry, this is not how knights are suppose to act.
  Finn, knights are loyal to their king.| I'm still not sure...
  Aa Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Loyalty to the King! | Can't argue with that!
 Other| The Nice King is not looking for a relationship right now.
  |  He's just not ready for a relationship!
  Alright! We did it, dude! |  I feel terrible, I need to talk to the Nice King about this.
 Other| Nice King, may I speak with you for a moment?
 Other| I don't like treating princesses this way, I don't wanna... I don't wanna do this anymore.
 Other| Oh, it's not that. It's just, princesses are suppose to be treated with niceness.
 Other| Hey, what's wrong with you!
 Other| What?! No, man!
  I can be smooth!  Finn, punch out my lumps.| What?!
  I can be whatever he wants! I can change!| I can't punch a princess!
 Other| Oooo...
  Yes! Hit me, hit me, hit me!|  Uuh, I'm sorry, Lumpy Space Princess, I just can't punch you!
  Are you serious?! Fine, I'll do it myself. | Princess no!
  This is all your fault, Finn!  Aaaaaah!| King, I'm sorry, I just can't do this anymore
 Other| Huh?
 Other| What jig?
 Other| Oh, wow, awesome! What is it?
 Other| Wha?!
 Other| Yes, finally something knight-like!
  Did this Ice King shave his back or something?| Ha ha!  The Nice King's razor , Jake, look, check this out- Aaaah! 
  Relax, dude, it's just me.|  Ha ha, you look just like the Ice King.  And so do I.
  Heh hee heh. These whiskers would make anyone look like the Ice King.| Ha haa, yeah, even the Nice King!
 Other|  Nice King!
 Other| Yeah and also this! 
  Pfft, he knows what it is!| Let's get him Jake! 
  Stop! We're not gonna let you beat up the Nice King.| He's not the Nice King, he's the Ice King!
  Man, these ladies really wanna get married.|  Jake, we can't beat up princesses!
 Other| Let me help ya!

 Other| Yaaaaaaa!  Now fly, ya liar! 
 Other| Now that's what I call, a close shave!
  Get it, get it!|  Yah!

  Don't you ever let me catch you here again!| Whoo-hoo! Ya ha ha ha ha!  Agh! Ow!  Ooooooow! Agh agh mee duh!
  Did he get you with his poison stingers?| No, I got a splinter from the door.
  Let me see. Wow, that's a tiny splinter.| But it hurts! I'm gonna need some...  ...finger protection! Thanks, Choose Goose.
  I am Choose Goose. Come back for some juice! Ha ha ha ha ha!| Man, I am so protected right now!
  That is mighty thick. Go on, hit me! | Hey guys! Check this out! Dude, hit me!  Oww!  On my armor!
  Oh. |  Click-click!
  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, you foolish boy. Without full body armor, you're weak! You do not look  Click-click! Ha ha ha ha. Yah! | Choose Goose, I need more armor.
  I've got something for you -- a metal shoe! Don't ya know you might stub your toe?| Uhh, no, Choose Goose. I need...
  Protect his butt! Protect his butt!|  No, Choose Goose. I want--
  Look at his butt!  Look at his butt!|  Choose Goose, I want the most  Click-click armor you have!
  Ooh, have a look! |  I'll take that one! 
  Say what?| No way! Choose Goose, this stuff is overpriced!
  No money for me? How about a poem for free?|  A poem?
   Your quest begins in the marsh over the hill.| Ah, yes! I'm gonna get that armor!
  Good luck exposing your soft, vanilla-strawberry skin to the elements, dork! Haaaaaaa! Later, losers! | Ja!  He's just jealous that I'm gonna have cooler armor than him!
  What's the poem say?|" ""The sun nibbles on the clouds, and gum drop tears rain down."" I don't get it..."
   Hmm... It means that we have to cross that swamp.| How'd you understand that?
  You don't just read the poetry to understand it. You got to  feel it. Trust me, dude-- I'm smarter than everyone. Now get in there!| You're not coming?
  No way, man. This armor thing is your deal!  I'll wait for you on the other side.|  This place will be a piece of... 
  Aah!| Aaaaah!!! Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!  Aaaaaaaaah!!!
   My most private parts peeped by a boy!| Huuuh!!! 
  Aah! Pervert!| I'm not a pervert! 
  You should be ashamed of yourself!| I'm sorry! I'm sorry!  Aah!
  My privates!| I'm sorry!
  My privates!| I'm sorry!
  You okay, man?| No! 
  What's the matter, crimson cheeks? Feeling a little embarrassed in the swamp of embarrassment?  You're so red, you look like a tomato. Ha ha ha ha! | Aahhhh! We'll see who's embarrassed when I get that armor! What does the poem say?
"   Hmm... Ooh! ""The meadow weeps as morning sings of milk and honey and things to come."""| What does that even mean?!
  Huh! | Aw, man! I don't know how to silence that!
  All right, I'll handle this one, dude. | No. This is my burden.
  Then just make her think it's her idea. That's how you make the ladies do what you want.|  Hey, Monster Lady! Hey! Stop crying!
  Huh?| Stop crying because that's what you want to do!
  Hu ha huh? | Huh?! Ahh!!! Ahh!!! Ahh ahh ahh!!! Ahh ahh!!! 
  Ha ha ha! She thinks you're her red-faced baby or something. I think she wants ya to nurse, dude! | Noo!!!
  Grandfathers will sing that to their grandchildren for generations to come.| Grandfathers will not sing that to their children! 
  Armor,  Click-click. | Just wait till I have the Armor of Zeldron!
  Yeah! Just you wait, weirdo!  Uh, Finn? Uh-oh. | Jake? You okay? Huh? 
  Yeah!| Awesome!
  Whoa! | Finally!  Yah! 
  Hello!| Begone, ghost! I'm here for the armor!
  Drop Ball is an extremely addictive, high-intensity game designed for people everywhere. Here, let me show ya.  Hut! One point.  Two points. Three points.| This game looks awful.
  Oh, no. I absolutely disagree!|  Dude, let's just kill him and get the armor.
  Here. It's your turn. Now, I don't want you to be intimidated, but my high score is six!| Guh! Just -- just toss it on the ground. 
  Finn, its so beautiful!| Yeah -- guess all the embarrassment was worth it. 
  Greetings, young traveler. We know what you seek, and you shall receive it.  Behold -- the Armor of Zeldron! It will protect you from evil, even ghosts. | Huh?! Aah!!  No! Dude, this is lady armor!
   Click-click!| No! Not Click-click! No more embarrassment!  I don't need armor! 
  I give you firsthand tips that no one else knows, and this is how you thank me?! I absolutely disagree with that!  Raarg!| Now what?
  Put on the armor! It'll protect you from evil, even ghosts!| Never! Yaaaaaaah! 
  | Whoa.
  No problem, dude. I couldn't have done it without  the power of embarrassment!| And I learned I don't need armor to be -- 
  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Look at you losers. Finn, you don't have any armor, and your friend is dressed like a lady! Ha ha ha! So not Click-click! | Well, at least I don't spend my day following a kid around! Get a life, dude! 
  Be quiet! I -- I am more Click-click than all of you!| Come over here and say that to my fist!
  Okay, I will!  Whoa! Er... Ugh, this armor's too heavy! Ah, no problem. I'll just prop myself up on this stick.  Aghhh! Splinter!| Hey, Sir Slicer, maybe you can use this!  Here you go! 
  Oh!| Free of charge!
   Come on, dude, let's get out of here.| Ha ha!  Okay, buddy. 
   Blankie me. Blankie me, Finn!| I'll get your blanket dude, where is it?
  Right here. | Why don't you just get it yourself?
  Because I'm sick! | Poor guy...
  Too hot!  URGGH!| Oh man, Jake, is there anything I can do to make you feel better?
  Soup me, Finny.| Soup-flavored cure coming on through. 
  Soup-flavored cure coming on through. | Do you feel better now?
  Yes.  Tell me a story... | Once upon a time...
  No! I already heard that story before.| But you've all ready heard all of my stories before.
  Make me a new one, Finn. A new story.| Okay... got it! Once upon a time...
  Nooo! | What's the matter?
  I don't want a made-up story. I need a real story.| Hmm. Now you hang on, my friend. I'll be right back.  Okay, world, give me a story for Jake!  Huh!  Jake, Jake! Check it out! This true story is going to totally cure you!
  Oh my gosh! What is it?| First, the leaf fell off a tree. But wa-w-w-wait.
  Spit it out.| The snail was on the leaf. The end.
 Oh no, now I feel a thousand times worse. Finn, a story's gotta have excitement, romance...  ...suspense,  and it has to have a happy ending. | But I don't know how to make that stuff happen!
  That's okay, buddy. Just dig me a hole and -- actually, two holes. One for my guts and one for my face, 'cause when I die, my guts are gonna blow outta my face.| I am not gonna let that happen, dude.
  Then go get me that story.  And make sure it has all the stuff on this list.| I'll be back as fast as a can. I won't let your guts blow outta your face.  Hmm. Romance. That should be easy. 
  I'll be back as fast as a can. I won't let your guts blow outta your face.  Hmm. Romance. That should be easy. | Hey, how 'bout you two. Are y'all in love?
  La ba ghee na goo da dee da?| Uh...
  La na ghee ga ra la na!| Umm.  Are y'all kissing in there?
  Ah!  | Hmm. Maybe I should smooooth out my approach a bit. ♪Normal guy, forest guy. Just like normal forest guy.♪  Whoa! . Hey, so, uh, yeah... so, yeah, can I, umm... can I watch you guys kissing?
  Uh!| I just need to for my friend! He's really sick and unless I tell him about watching you guys kissing and...
"   Yeah, what's this ""friend's""  name, huh?"| Jake! His name's Jake.
  Yeah.| Wait! I'll do anything! 
  Would you eat dirt?| I would for Jake!  Okay, now you guys kiss.
  Let's go.| What! No! Jake needs this! Stop!  Just come on!
  AUGGH!|  You see, no big deal.
  Oh no, oh no! I really did want to kiss Boobafina! I'm secretly in love with her!| Okay, sweet!
  No, no. It had to happen naturally! Now she'll never love me! |Ugh!  That wasn't smooth, but it's all worth it to save Jake. Whatever it takes. Okay, a good fight...  Hey, you want to fight me?
  You killed him and now he's dead!|  He's probably not dead. I'm sorry though, that you think he's dead. Mmm, I don't want to hurt aminals, but - but Jake -  Okay, what's next?  Ohhhhhhhhhh, suspense... 
  Boys! Boys! Have you seen my boys?|  No!  Awwwwww, I can't do it! I keep messing with folks, aaaaaaaahh!!!  Jake needs me, but I can't keep messing with folks, but Jake's really sick, but I can't but, but, but, but...uhhh!!!    Oww, hey, who threw -- ahhhhhhhhh!!!!  Wait, what's happening, are you guys gonna eat me?!
  You'll see...|  Hey, wait, this is really suspenseful! 
   Hey, wait, this is really suspenseful! | What is this?
  Finn the human boy, for your crimes of the inhabitants of the forest... you must enter the earth and become one with the soil...| Don't I get a trial or something?!
  Huzzah! | I'm totes gonna die... and now Jake won't get his story and he'll die too... because I still don't have a happy ending... huh??
  Oo iggi, boo boo, oo iggi, boo boo, oo iggi, boo boo, oo iggi...| Wait a minute! I may be busy dying... but you need to get busy living...
  Huh?| Y'all living some unhappy lives. You, Boobafina...
  | You love Mr. Goose. You just need to tell him.
  What?| She loves you... y'all just need to hook it up.
  Huzzah!| And you Mr. Fox, you need to face facts man. Boobafina is not interested. It's time to move on.
  It's true... it's for the best.| And hey, jerky teenage bear!
  What?| Your mom is right. You shouldn't just go around fighting strangers in the forest.
  Yeah! | Momma bear, your son's not a baby anymore. You should stop spanking him in the face.
  He's right... It's time to let you grow up...| Yeah! That's the stuff!
  Huzzah!| And Mrs. Cow, take that bag off your udder. You're beautiful, girl. You live in the forest, so why don't you just let it hang out?
  Silence! Finn the Human, for meddling in our lives and disturbing the order of the forest...  we thank you.| What?!
   Our lives have improved since you came here.| Does that mean you're going to release me?
  Your cage is made of sticks, brother. Just kick it apart.| Cool!  Yeah! I'm coming for you, Jake... with a story!!!
  And then what happened? | And then everyone in the forest was happy... The end.
  Huuuuuuuuh!!!| What's wrong?!
  That was...  perfect! I feel a million times better!| Really?
  Yeah! The romance stopped my fever... the suspense cured my headache... and everything else cured everything else! I'm not sick, I'm not sick!| Ha ha! Neat. 
   Finn, c'mon! Dance the health dance with me.| Nah, I'm good. 
  You allergic to my health dance?|  No, I just feel bad.
  Ohhhh... Finn, did you catch my sick?| 
  Hey, dude, can I borrow that paper?| Mm-hmm.
  | Oh, sick!
  Ugh!| Dude, how do you fight a snail?!
  Salt?! But I heard you guys were heroes.| We are heroes. We thought you were trying to attack us. Why'd you break in here all mad, squirting that juice all over us?
  It's not mad juice. It's sad juice. My name's Snorlock, and I'm sa-a-a-a-d! | Stop squirting slime! Just tell us what's wrong!
  I need a girlfriend. I have no one to love.| Jake, hero huddle.  What do you think?
  I think our house is all jacked up.| Yeah, but he's just an innocent goober looking for love.
  Yeah. Okay, let's help him. But he's got to lay off the house.| Right! All right, man. We'll help you hook up as long as you—
   You guys... won't help me? | All right! all right! We'll help you, dude! Just put our house back!
  Okay! Right after I get a girlfriend.| Aw! All right, you big crazy. It's a deal.
  | Jake, what time is it?!
  Lady time! | Okay, Snorlock, if you want a lady, you have to be yourself.
  How do I be myself?| Uh, how does he be himself, Jake?
  Finn, you see any hot mamas?|  Ummm... Baaaaaam!
  He's got this.| Yeah.
  Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend!| Dude! our house! We got to do something!
  Aw, who could leave you? Come here, you big hot mess. | Break it up, you two! We have ladies to attend to!
  No, it's not. Check it out, Snorlock. Finn, you be the guy snail, and I'll be...  the chick snail.| Ugh! gross, Jake!
  | Okay. I'll do it for this guy.
  |  What's up, lady snail?
   Well, I'm just sitting here thinking about mating with snails.| No! I can't do this, man! I-am-out!
   Hey, baby. What's up?| Uh... WHA!
  Mm-mmm!  mm-mmm!  Girl, you smell good. Did you take a bath in rainbows and cupcakes?| 
"  Say ""yes""!  Say ""Yes""!  Say ""YES""!  Say ""Yes""!"| Okay! Yes!
  Man, I wish you guys were ladies.| Uhh.
  Umm, hey, Finn, teach him how to use swords. The princesses always love this one.|  Yah! yah! yah! yah! Yaaaah! hyah!
  Yeah, Snorlock! Show us that talent!| Whoo-hoo!
  Oh, my! What is that? What is that wonderful sound? Do I see swords?| Jake, these chicks look pretty serious.
  Look at him go! Bringing in the ladies.| Uh, he's bringing in a lot of ladies.
  | Snorlock! These ladies are ruining our tree house! Stop!
  Wedge, dude!|  
   It's no use, man. It's stuck with snail slime.| 
  Finn! Aah! | How are we gonna get our house back?
   Dude, I'm going in.| Wha? Jake! No! You'll get slimed or grinded on!
   Hmph!|  
  Me, a slug?| Yeah, man. That's why you have trouble with snail chicks. You need slug chicks.
  I don't know why they have to make out so close to our house.| I don't know. Come on, let's finish rebuilding it. I got some ear plugs you can borrow.
  I don't know. Come on, let's finish rebuilding it. I got some ear plugs you can borrow.| Where's that music coming from?
   Go! go! go! go!| BMO! Get over here and help us rebuild the tree house.
  Yup!| Good, 'cause we're gonna need it for this... ROOF PARTY!  Watch this, everybody! Triple flip with chips for the dip! 
  I said you don't FOCUS AT ALL! Hey, Finn, do another flip.|  YUP! YAH!
  Hahaha!! You're a dynamo, Finn!!| YEAH!! I NEVER SLOW DOWN!!
"  ""Never slow down?"""| Whoa. Dude, can you, like, get offa' me?
   Do you think your energy could be used to power a huge machine?| I guess so, man.  Hey, Jake  Your friend is super weird, dude.
  It's starting, everyone! The celestial alignment!|  Jake! That party was super fun! 
  Man, I'm sleepy. | Then go to sleep, man!
  Huh? Oh, yeah, right.  Goodnight, homie.|  Hyump! Ahh!  Goodnight, hamlet. 
  Welcome, Finn.| Huh?  UNTIE ME SO I CAN BEAT YOU WITH THAT SACK!!  You're that—
  And...  ruler of the Beneathaverse!|  'S pretty nice. Hey, why don't you guys just untie me, and we can pretend this whole thing didn't happen?
  Oh, no! I've been searching all over Ooo for the perfect power source! A living dynamo! Something that... never slows down.| Uh-oh.
  And last night, I finally found—|  It's me.
  Yes!! It's you!! You will have the great honor of powering the Upturnoverdrive!| That does what now?
  It will flip over the entire world! Then we'll be the ones on top, buddy!| THAT'S BIZONKERS!
  Yes, but the engineering is very sound.|  Huh?
  Your energies will be harnessed by our most advanced technology. The Cyclonic Rodentarod!| Ha! You may have captured me... Hugh!  ...but you can't make me run!  Ow! Well... you can't make me run very fast.  OW!! Jake's on his way to mess you guys  UUUOOOOAAAHH!!
  Congratulations. You fully charged the Alternator! Now it's time to power up the Plasma Ball... with sexy, fun dancing!| NO! STOP! NOOOOO!!!! WHA! AAH!! 
  All finished.| Finished, huh?  Finished... Finished... Fin... Fin... Finn...  AWWW, FINN! Darn it! My best friend's missing! I gotta get my head together!  Touching.  Tasting.  Looking.  Little footprints! Too small to be Finn's... More like a bunch-a'-gnomes-carrying-something footprints!
  Now... for the final stage!  The brain machine!!| NO.
  YES! THIS MACHINE WILL SUCK THE ENERGY FROM YOUR THOUGHTS!  ...To start our Upturnoverdrive.|  Don't think, Finn... Don't think anything.  Can't... let... them... WIN!!  No more games. No... more... PAJAMAS!!! 
  NOOOOO!!!| Jake?!?!
  LET'S KICK IT!! | Wha?!
  HAH-HAH!  I BET I CAN LIFT THIS THING!!  WAAAAHH!!!| Jake?!  JAKE!!!  You defeated the Gnomes!!
  I did?!| Yeah, man!!
  And you're okay?!| Yeah, man, I'm fine!!!
  Haha! Then I did it! I saved you by being an unfocused, rowdy party dog!| Hahaha, yeah, dog!!
 ♪Apple pie in the oven, Tell me you can taste lovin'♪|Hmm...
 Yo, man, what's going on?|I found this crystal on our door step, it's pretty mysterious, I'm trying to find information about it using the holobook.
 Oo, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough Guy contest!  Whoo-hoo!  Tough Boys!| Wait man, doesn't this look like Tree Trunks' lipstick?
 That's impossible, Tree Trunks exploded in the scary dark forest after she ate that Crystal Gem Apple, remember?|Yeah, I remember. 
 Come on man! Tough Guy contest me!|Ha! 
  you got what it takes to rip-it?!|Uh, yeah! 
 Then let's get it on!|Yeah-yo!
  Do it, Finn, do it! |
 |  Noooooo!
 I'm gonna break out! |No way!
  I'm breaking out of my fat!  I win, Finn! Finn?  Finn, Finn! Are you okay?! |
  I was just messing with ya, dude.| I... was just... messing with... you  
  Are you okay?| Yeah,  I'm just going to rest my muscles. 
 | 'Sup, dude?
 Finn, you're okay! I was afraid I mashed your potatoes too hard last night.|Ha, you didn't mash my potatoes!  You didn't even make me cry silently into my pillow last night for- thirty minutes. In fact, you read to go again tough stuff?!
 Nope, no more, dude.|What?!
 I never wanna lose control again, man! I'm going totally soft |You look like a wuss!
 Mmm hmm.|  Hey, the crystal is glowing a different color! 
 Whoa...|Chip-chap-chop, what's going on?!
 Uh, which one of you is Finn the Human?|It depends on who's asking, are ya'll good or evil?
 Uh, we're good.|Oh, I'm Finn
  Hey, you guys, put my bro down.|Jake! 
 Finn! |Hey!
 Hey, man, what happened?|I don't know, but I'm trapped in this crystal ball, get me out of here!
 Um, well, it's a secret but part of it is we're turning Finn into a crystal.|Jake, you can stop these guys now! 
 Ah, man!| get me out of here!
 No, dad, I gotta control myself!  Control, control, control, con-trol.| Help! My arm! 
 Yeah, man. | JAKE, HELP!
  Yeah. Yes|Don't make fun of him, he's having problems, everybody has- 
 So, help me I will touch you!| JAKE! AHH! HELP!!
  cut it out he looks good.|MY BODY!!  
  I'm sorry, Finn, I'm super lame and now...you're dead.|I'm not dead, I'm just all crystal stiff.
 That voice.|It sounds like-
  Yes, Finn, it's me, Tree Trunks.  but in this world I am known as Quartzion the Crystal Queen.|Oh my grosh, you're alive!
 Yes, yes I know, but you love... is not enough   I wanted you, Finn, so you could be transformed into my sexy crystal king.|Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas with crystal power!
 Finn, it's not sexy for a king to call his queen bananas! |Jake, you totally gotta stop her!
 Whoa there, don't you put your junk on my trunk! |Go, Jake, go!
 Oh, well then I'm over it then! Rarr |Jake, kick Tree Trunks in the tummy, shes probably still got that crystal gem inside her!
  Oh, dear.|
 Oh shush, Tree Trunks, if I had a penny for every time someone went crazy hopped up on magic energy... I'd be Abraham Lincoln!|Tree Trunks, you're okay!
 Finn!|I'm okay toooo! 
 Oh, Finn, I was trapped here for so long and all I could think about was you and how your so nice to me and I, and I just wanted to say... I think... you're cute and I like you.| Okay, okay, let's go.
 Finn, when we get home, it's apple pie time.|Ooooh!! 
 Hey Princess! Here I go!  I'm stuck.|Princess, let us deliver the tarts.
 Are you sure Finn? This is really important.| Princess, I have never been more sure of anything in my whole life!  I'll do anything it takes to keep you alive and safe. We won't let you down.
 Welcome to the Tartorium!| Wow.  They're so beautiful.
 Now, I want you to tote those tarts through that tunnel.  The Royal Tart Path takes you directly to the Royal Congressional Hall in the Bad Lands. The path is really safe and well protected, but keep your eyes open for any sign of danger, okay?|Mmm hmm.
 Good. Now here's your map. | Hey Princess, what are all these bubbling chemicals all over the place?
 That's paralyzing potion, Finn! Don't touch it. It'll paralyze you forever! |Oh. 
 All right, let's hit it. |Wait. I got a sick plan! 
 Wait. I got a sick plan! |Go!
 Okay.  Bye! Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Bye!| Goodbye! You'll be fine! Hahaha!
  Heh, that was fun, but why'd you do it?| Look, everyone expects the tarts to on that Royal Tart Path. Cinnamon Bun will be our decoy while we take the one path no thief expect a tart toter to take
  I guess this is it.| Huh, not as scary as I thought it'd be.
  Yeah, man, mostly just looks empty. I mean, what thief would ever hang out here? There's nothing to steal!| You know, I think my plan might be kinda brilliant. I mean, I'm not saying I'm the brilliant, but it's a pretty brilliant plan, I think.
  True, true. This place is perfect for toting tarts.| Yeah, and the Back-Rubbing Ceremony is right over those mountains.  This tart tote is gonna be a total tart walk.
  Heheheh, yeah. Ohh, wait! Hold up!| What is it?
  Shh.  It's a campfire—close by.|  Does it smell like a tart thief's campfire?
  Maybe.| Better check it out—can't be too careful. 
  Hush.  I ain't gon' burn it.| Crud! I was sure we'd be safe in the Desert of Doom!
  What? Whatcha sayin'?| Those are dirty tart burglers!
  I think they're just dirty hobos.| No, man, they are cold-blooded tart destroyers and we have to get them before they get us.
  Why?| They're gonna kill Princess Bubblegum by stealin' our tarts!
   You got tarts?| You know we do! And the next time you want to steal one—!  You picture this guy right here  chewin' on your brain!  What the—?!  That thing's gettin' the tarts!
  You know we do! And the next time you want to steal one—!  You picture this guy right here  chewin' on your brain!  What the—?!  That thing's gettin' the tarts!| Son of a—.
  Uh-oh, man, he got, like, five or six!| But... my brilliant plan.
  Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum.| What the—? 
  Hey, Finn.|  
  I'm just checking in using the holo-pendant. How are my tarts doing?| They're, um... th-they're—
  They're radical! No tart problems here!| Uhh, yeah! Right! Everything's, uh—bazoobs! Oh, look, something is eclipsing the sun. It's so dark now. 
  I think the plan went awry.| No! All this was just some freak bad luck, but we still got some tarts and the princess is still safe.
  Okay.| You know what? Even though it totally wasn't our fault, it's probably for the best that we lost those tarts. 
  Huh? How?| Well, it's like a reminder to really stay sharp and play it extra safe.
  Well, it's like a reminder to really stay sharp and play it extra safe.| For instance, take this scary cavern, here. No sane person would ever bring a tart down there. So...
  So no thieves!| Exactly.
  Yeah, P.U.!| Jake?
  Yeah?| Hey, man, did you just, like, sniff my butt?
  Uh, just now?| Yeah.
  No.| Huh. Alright.
  Hmm. Hey, Finn?| Yeah, Jake?
  Did you just, uh, lick me—all the way up my arm?| No.
  Hmm. Strange.| Jake, let me see those matches.
  Uh-oh! Man, we got got! There's only two left!| What?!
  Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum.| Aaaaah!
  Hello?| We blew it, man! My plan sucked—it sucked all along—but I was blinded by my hubris! Now PB is gonna get got, and it's all my fault!
  Whoa, whoa, take it easy, buddy. We've still got two whole tarts left. PB is gonna be fine.| You really think so?
  Hey! Keep off them tarts!| Huh?
  I said back off of them tarts! Are you an imbecile?!| But I—
  Yeah! That's it. Alright,  now I gotta book it to Nana's for brunch! See youse later!| It's over. PB's gonna get croaked.
  Mmm, yeah—or... we could smash in there and stop Congress from chopping her head off.| You're right! Jake, let's go save Princess Bubblegum!
  Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop!| NOOOOO!!!!
  NOOOOO!!!!| Aaaaah! ... Huh?
  Let the annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony begin!| Dude, they were just slicing tarts!
  Hey!| He must have delivered the decoys...
  the ones we poisoned!| Nooo!
  Nooo!| Princess, don't eat that tart!
  Okay! Jeez, Finn, I won't eat that tart. I'll eat this other tart instead!| No, Princess, no!
  No, Princess, no!| The princess has been paralyzed!
  I'm not paralyzed! I'm gripped with the flavor!| That means we must have been carrying the poisoned tarts all along!
  That means we must have been carrying the poisoned tarts all along!| Yep! All part of my master plan.
  Excuse me! What is this about poisoned tarts and alternate plans?| I-I—alright, here it comes.  I had a brilliant plan to tote the tarts along a dangerous path, but I mucked it up.  You oughtta give this toter job to Cinnamon Bun. He's the real hero.
   Yeah! | I'm sorry for not following your instructions and for lying to you about it.
  Oh, Finn, I forgive you—'cause I lied to you, too! They weren't going to decapitate me; I just said that so you guys wouldn't eat the tarts!| Oh!
  So I guess we're even.| Uhh, yeah, I guess so.
  Hello? Eat my tarts? This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win—and it can— then I'll still be here tomorrow, to high-five you yesterday, my friends. Peace.| Sheesh!
  Coming up.  I know what you're thinking about.|  Huh?
  Kissin' Princess Bubblegum on the mouth!|  No, I'm not! And... I wouldn't even do that ever.
  Yeah, you would. You're just bad at talking to ladies.| Hmmph.  Ehggg-uh-ya-uh. Uh, should I keep going, Mrs. Yoder?
   No, Finn, that's plenty. Thank you.| Okay.  Let us know if you need anything else. Hyah!
  You two are heroes!|  Hunh.
  Come on, dude.| Hey! Do you hear that? She called us heroes!
  Hey! How's it going?!  Ugh! Is that true, what the bird said? You guys are heroes?| Why were you hiding in that shrub?
  So listen, I need you two heroes to get me a lock of princess hair. | Why do you need princess hair?
  Anyway, I need the princess hair so I can put it on my head.  And then I'll be beautiful.| Oh, well, uh, we know lots of princesses.
   Dude, I don't think we should help her.|  Why not?
  'Cause she's a witch!| Maybe she's a good witch.
  Are you guys still talking?!| So what do we do? Tell her we can't help her 'cause she's ugly?
  We were just saying someone as pretty as you doesn't even need a full head of hair.  Isn't that right, buddy?| Uh, yeah, totally!
  Oh. Umm…| Dude, I don't think it's working.
  Hmm.| Look, Lady, we can't help you get princess hair.
  Why not?| Because... we only help when someone's in danger. 
  I told you she was evil!| Grrrrrr.... Yaah!
  What, you forget I'm a witch?| Maybe.
  Nyuh! Get some princess hair!!| All right, fine! 
  Wait! Uh, you... you can't tell anyone why you need it.| What? Why?
  I don't want anyone to know I have a balding problem.| O...kay. 
  O...kay. | It's Princess Muscles's castle! 
  Hi, Finn.| Uh, hey, Princess Muscles.
  What brings you by?| Um, you were the nearest princess, and I need a lock of your hair.
  I understand.| You do?
  Mm-hmm. | Aah! What are you doing?
  Trying to give you a hug.| Why? I want hair, not hug!
  Oh, I see. You want to take things slo-o-o-w.| No! I--I'm here to save you! From your hair! It looks really bad. Cut it off, quick!
  Of course it looks bad. If I had beautiful, shiny hair, no one would look at my muscles.  Come back when you wanna get serious about loving me!| I am terrible at talking to ladies.
  I am terrible at talking to ladies.| Hmm... Where's a princess? Princess?... Princess... Princess... Who's that?  It's Lumpy Space Princess.  Does she... live in the woods now?
   G-G-Get away from my camp! I'll cut you! Hrm. I'm never gonna go back home.| Huh. Wait. Does she even have hair?  She does! Well... hair is hair.
  Oh, my Glob! What the stuff are you doing?! Why are you cutting my lumps?!| Because they're, uh... So--
   I knew you liked me.| No, I don't! I-I'm just stopping by because--
  Just admit it, Lover Boy! You can't resist me! Well, if you want these lumps, you gotta put a ring on it! Where's my ring?!  I knew you liked me, Finn. That's why you're running! Get in touch with your feelings, babe!|" What am I gonna do? Huh? A graveyard? Yes! There's got to be a hairy princess in there that won't think I'm hitting on her! Princess? Princess? Princess? Ugh! Come on! Bingo!  ""Here lies Princess Beautiful. She was so beautiful."" Hey, that's perfect! And sort of macabre. Oh, well.  Aha! "
  Hi, Finn.| Ohh!
  What? What are you -- Please stop.| Where's her hair?!
  Thanks, Finn. |" ""Here lies Princess Beautiful. She was so beautiful, but died of baldness?!"" Dang it!"
   I'm gonna look so beautiful... Invited to all the parties.|  Jake! Jake! I'm sorry, man. Getting princess hair is -- is impossible! They all just think I'm in love with them! Ugh! I can't do it. You're gonna have to spend the rest of your life in this witch's butt.
   Dude, if they think you like them, then use that. Embrace it! Find the least terrible princess you can, play her some music, cook her a meal, smoove talk her until she likes you. And then get the hair!| Wait. You mean like go on a date?
  Marry a princess if you need to! Just get her hair! Aaaah!| Jake!
   Go get the hair!| Okay! Hold on!
  Okay! Hold on!| Princess Bubblegum!
  Hi, Finn!| Uh... I need you to come with me!
  Why? I'm watering right now.| Just come on. We don't have much time!
  What is this, Finn?| We're gonna have a spaghetti dinner.
  Um, Finn?| Put your butt here! Hurry!
  Oh. | Hey, Simon, make it romantic.  Oww! Here, shove this in your mouth! It's hot!
  Finn, I don't understand--| Please, Princess! Just stick it in your mouth!
  Well, okay.   You're lucky I love spaghetti!| Um, Princess... do you like me?
   Finn, of course I like you.| Really?
  Yeah!| Yes! Now give me some of your hair!
  Oh, Finn, that's sweet. Sure, I'll give you some of my hair.  Here. Take it, you cutie.| Thank you, Princess Bubblegum!! 
"  My cat had kittens... and I'm thinking of naming one ""Little Whiner."" What do you think? Is that a good name?"| Totally did it! Genuine princess hair. You hear that, Jake?
   Just give it to her, already!!| All right, lady, a deal is a deal.
  What?!| It is bubblegum!
  Aaaah!| WAAIT!
  What?| If I learned anything today, it's that I'm awesome at talking to ladies! And, lady, you are crazy ugly!
  Duuuude!| Having beautiful hair isn't gonna get you anywhere, because you're ugly, inside and out, so ugly I want to throw up.
  Duuuude!| No one will ever find you beautiful. everrr! And it's got nothing to do with the ol' chrome dome. It has to do with what's in here.  Can you get off my friend now?
  Well, don't get me wrong. I know I'm ugly. And evil.  But I thought if I had some beautiful hair, I could learn how to love myself.| Gee... I feel kind of bad.
  I don't.| Hey, witch! Does it have to be princess hair?
  No. Just beautiful hair.| Well then, check this out!  HA HA-A-A-A-A-A!!!
  You'd really give me your hair?| Sure!
   So... how do I look?| Totally beautiful.  inside and out!
  Thank you, Finn. And now to use my hair for evil.|  What?!
  And if I do this hand position,  my boogers should turn into smoke bombs.|Pfff. You sure this tip is good, Flambo?
  Come on, you know I'm on the level. The Ice King is scheming to nabs a princess today. I swears it.|Hmm.
  Ninjas? Ninjas ain't real for nothing, no how.|Whoa, now—ninjas are real. For you see,  Doo, doo, doo... Jake and I are ninjas.
 Yep, ever since we fished this ninja manual out of a ditch. Finn, booty me!| Listen!
 Wenk, wenk!|It's the Ice King, all right, and he's looking awful pleased with himself.
 Uh-oh. If the Ice King's so happy, he must have stolen a princess when we weren't looking, somehow.  That's ninja logic.|Then we gotta...
  Ahem.|...we gotta save that princess.
 You got it, shino-bro! Ninja kick!|Ninja kick!
 Ninja kick!|Princess? Princess!
  Princess?| Princess!
 No princess here, man.|No princess?  It's... a trap! We're being trapped! Ninja vanish! Evade! Evade!
 Nothing is trapped, dude. We can't find any captured princesses, because the Ice King hasn't captured one yet. He's out doin' it right now.|Are you sure?
  No. It's only a ninja hunch, so we should ninja snoop for proof.|Wait, man. I-I feel uncomfortable snooping through Ice King's personal stuff. It feels sorta like...  a violation.
  Whoo! Got the Ice King's diary.| No, no, no, no, no! We can't read his private junk! 
 And yet we must.  Dear diary—and you better write me back this time!—  today I'm bringing home a special new cutie.|There's our proof, man! ... Hmm, alright. Let's use our ninja stealth and hide until he comes back with the princess.
 Or... we could keep looking through his stuff. Heh, heh, heh! You know, for more proof? Hehehe!|No.  Alls we're gonna do is lie in wait until the Ice King gets back. Then—BOOM —we catch him with princess on his hands. 
 Where are we gonna hide?|In this filthy hamper!  Think he's there yet?
 In this filthy hamper!  Think he's there yet?|See anything?
 Nah. Hey, Finn, I don't want to hide in the hamper anymore; it reeks in here.|But we're ninjas! And this is our ninja hideout.
 Nah, man. My sense of smell is, like, one thousand times better than yours. Also, the hamper's boring. I'm out.|Wait!
 I'm out!|Jake! Get back here!   Hey, wait up!
 Check this out!|Weird.
 I want to draw something.|Hey!  We gotta leave no trace! Ninjas leave no trace!
 I'll delete it after!|Hey, come on!
 Hey, come on!| Jake, what have we done?
 What kind of guy builds a cave inside of another a cave?  What's this? A spellbook?  Whoo!|Dude! Leave no trace!
 Ah, it's too late for that.|It's not too  ...late. WHOA!
 What'cha got there?|Dude! It's a first-edition Ice Ninja Manual!
 Dude! It's a first-edition Ice Ninja Manual!| A true ninja passes no wind; he only passes... 
  I ain't even heard of these techniques.  Nuh-nuh-n-numm-nuh  numb-chucks.|Hey. Ice King seems way into ninjas, even more than we are.
  Yeah, so? |So... doesn't that mean that ninjas must be... kinda lame?
 Nah, they're still cool. But Ice King's still lame because he hides his ninja love. We wear our ninja on our sleeves! |Jake! Show me how to do that.
 Other| Fridjitsu master Finn summons... dagger of chilled glass. 
  Fridjitsu master Jake summons... stars of frozen rain.  Get ready to be... star struck. |Get ready to be... cold cut!
 Hyah!| Kunai attack!
  Icicle kick!| Force of blizzard!
  Flying jump!|What?! Three Jakes? That's one too many. Caltrop hailstorm!  Those Jakes were all fakes!
  Heh! Fridjitsu master Jake summons... arrow of ice! |Hiyah!  Rad.
  WOOHOO! YEAH!|It's the Ice King! Hide!
 Other|  He's got a princess. Now we leap out and catch him red-handed. 
 Hai!|Snow blind! 
 Other|Ice King, hand over that princess!
 Other|Jake, where's the princess?
 Other|The, um... princess you were just talking to?
 Other|Ohh...
 Other|No princess?
 Other|We messed up, Jake. We're... violators!
 Other|We're... ninjas?
 Other|It's true.  Ice King, we're gonna make this right.
 Other|Doctor Princess!
 Other|What's goin' on?
  I don't know if stomachs work like that, dude.| Sometimes it helps.
  Can't argue with that!  Ahh...|  Ahh...
   Hello? Lady, it's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. Alright, I love you, too. Bye. | Lady Rainicorn again?
  Yeah, man. She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today. She thinks they're gonna freak out.| Um... maybe give her parents some treasure?
  No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, smooth them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous! It's perfect! I'll just send them a quick Prism-gram.  Mm-hmm. | What's it say?
  Hold on. It's still converting the light waves into brain waves.  Ahh... They're into it, dude!| Sweet! Let's go powder our noses!
  Sweet! Let's go powder our noses!| Why's Lady so nervous, anyway?
  Well... she didn't really say, but it might have somethin' to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars.| There were wars between rainicorns and dogs?
  Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension... but Lady and I are cool.| Dude! Her parents are probably all full of dog-hatred from the war-times! They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid Lady from ever hanging out with you again!
  ...Nah. That could never happen.| You didn't think this through enough... IT COULD HAPPEN!!
  AAAH! I'M A MORON!| Don't worry. I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz. Homies help homies. Always.
  I'm ready to hear your plan, homie.| Haha, yeah! This plan is perfect!
  You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so sure, man.| Come ooonnn. Trust me, homie.
  Your house is very colorful. I like that!|  Haha! The plan is working, homie!
  Uh... that's um...| I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate! Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance! 
  Uh... y-yes!  Get outta here, goblin! Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks!| But—
   Come on, homie, help me!|   Ha! You got it, homie!
  I...|  Snacks! Get your snacks!
   Finn!  Dude! I have to show Lady's parents that I have rainbow powers! I need homie help!| Hmm... I got a plan, bro-ham. Just stretch your horn at me, and I'll take care of the rest.
  You're the best, homie.| Homies help homies.
   Yo, my bad! I'll get 'im!  Hey, man. How's it goin'?|"  IT'S ""GOING"" CRUD-COW!"
  I know, I know, I'm sorry. But they really like me. Your plan is working perfectly!| Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan! Not in the plan!
  Wohhh, no. You're my guests. Let me take care of you.  Homie... help me cook something, please.| ...Okay.
  Ah! I was hoping!  I was afraid to ask!| WAAAH! Jake!! I think they wanna eat me!!
"  Of course we do! Jake said you'd ""make a great lunch""!"| JAKE! COME ON!
   Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man....| AAAH! Knock it off, Bob!! 
"  어, 나도 우리 부모님 때문에 걱정했었어! 우리 엄마아빠는 개라면 완전 맛이 가거든! 개가 전쟁터에서 우리 아빠 생명을 구해줬었어! (""Oh, I was worried about my parents! My mom and dad are crazy about dogs! A dog saved my dad in the war!"")"| What did she say?
  She said she worried that they'd freak out... 'cause her parents are bananas for dogs!| J.J. FLIP! What the zip?!
  Yeah! She says a dog saved her dad in the war!| Wow! That's flippin' awesome.
  Finn.|  ...Wha?
  It's just we thought we'd never get another chance. We thought humans were extinct.| Oh.
  Oh, no. This is soy people!| Oh.
 Oh.|Jake. Jake!  Hey man, shouldn't we conserve our energy? The Ice Cream Marathon starts tomorrow.
  I know what the Ice Cream Marathon is.  I've been training for weeks. And I am determined to eat more ice cream at the Ice Cream Marathon than anyone else!|You sure like ice cream.
 What the croak was that?|It came from over there .
 It came from over there .|Whoa, Jake! Check it out!
 |It's a brave little Gnome Knight.
 Oh. Well, you should just let go, man.|Yeah, you've had a good run.
 No! I cannot die until I find a being whose spirit is brave and pure to take over my quest.| Quest?
 Uh-oh.  Somebody's gonna do a quest for a frog.|Tell me more about this... quest.
 Beans?! Ah ha ha! Magic beans... hee! We'll be right back. Come on, Finn. I think I dropped my spoon in the bush. |We will take your quest.
 You will?|Sure!  Consider it guarded.
 Also, take this .| Oh. Okay. Thanks.
 No, thank you. |Whoa!
 Dude, what's goin' on?|We took over the quest!
 Nope, too late. |Ah, I miss him already.
 Well, we should get a move on if we wanna make the Ice Cream Marathon. |What about the quest?
  Really? We have to do the bean quest?|I gave him my word.
 Yeah, I wasn't here for that, so... can't we guard the beans and eat ice cream?|"No, man! We're on the job. And like you always say, ""Work and fun don't mix..."""
 Gee, sittin' in this hot sun, guarding beans. It sure beats 26 miles of vanilla ice cream. Or caramel ice cream. Or peach ice cream. Hey, what if we plant the beans ourselves?|That's a terrible idea.
 No, wait, hear me out. See,  if one of these beans is evil, then it's our duty to crush it, once and for all! Plus, two of the beans are good. If we plant them, we'll be bringin' twice as much good into the world!|And we can make it to the Ice Cream Marathon!
  I'm gonna take a cat nap.|What? But we have to be ready for evil!
  If we take shifts, there's less chance of us falling asleep at the same time. | Alright Finn, Jake's a lazy bum and this soil is ripe with evil. I cannot go to sleep until that evil bean sprouts and is destroyed.
  Alright Finn, Jake's a lazy bum and this soil is ripe with evil. I cannot go to sleep until that evil bean sprouts and is destroyed.|AAAH!  Wake up, Jake! This is it!
  Huh?  Oh!|Aah! Bean pod!  I can't tell if it's evil yet.
 Aah! Bean pod!  I can't tell if it's evil yet.|Huh? Baby Pigs dressed in silly costumes?
 Aw, look how cute they look all sleepy and snore-y.|Careful, Jake. It could be a trap. We should test them to see if they're... evil.
 Careful, Jake. It could be a trap. We should test them to see if they're... evil.|Okay. Each one of you take one test and one pencil. You have one hour to complete the test and prove we shouldn't kill you.  And begin.
 Aw, they're so cute they can hardly hold their pencils.|That doesn't fare well for their...  grade point average.
 Nothing evil could be this adorable.|" Hmm, you might be right.  The only thing on here is a cute drawing of an ice cream cone under ""Do you have allergies?"" Yeah,  nothing evil. Okay, the pigs are good."
 YES!  You hear that, guys? You passed! A-plus! A-plus-plus!|
 |Oh, no!  Jake, get ready. The second pod is about to drop. PROTECT THE PIGLETS!
  Stay back, babies!|Show me what you have to offer, pod!
 Show me what you have to offer, pod!|Magical wands?
 What? COOL! |Stop, Jake!
  WOW!|Is it evil?
 It's a wand that poops glitter! What's good-er than that?!  Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee! |Hmm...  Hahahaha! Glitter on its own could be evil. But with rainbows? Over my dead body!
 Hey, let's have some fun with these pigs before the evil pod shows up!|Yeah!
 I'm exhausted!|They look so sleepy and peaceful. We have to stay alert. The evil pod could appear at any time. When it does, we must be ready to destroy it immediately.
 And then go to the Ice Cream Marathon, right?| Yeah, man.
  Okay. I'll take the first shift.| Rhombus.
  Rhombus.|AH! Look! The third pod!
 It's bigger than the other two, dude!| Yeah, man. We've gotta kill it now.
 Huh?  It's squirting!|Squirting?! 
 See? Squirting. Right here.  Tastes good. |Dang, man! Don't just lick stuff! It's evil!
  No, it's not. It's... ice cream! |Is the evil sucking you in?  JAKE! 
  That was awesome.|Are you poisoned?! Are you dying?
 No, man! It was awesome!|Look, Jake! It's filling back up!
" Aw, yeah!  This pod makes ice cream out of nothing! It's the ""goodest"" thing that's ever happened to me!"|Well, if this pod's not evil....  The piglets are gone!
 And so are the fairy wands.| Let's go! The screaming sounds are getting stronger near Mushroom Town!
  Let's go! The screaming sounds are getting stronger near Mushroom Town!|Piglets! Stop this!
 Oof!|"Cram! Now I must find these wicked piglets' weakness and use it to ""retribuse"" them."
 Well, I found my weakness .|That's it! Ice cream!
  What about ice cream?| Yes... yes! HA! The exams confirm my memory of the piglets being allergic to ice cream.
 Just the thought of that scares me, man.|I see one of them! Get ready to release! RELEASE!
 Ah, gross! That's--EW!| Ah, gross man!
  Ah, gross man!|JAKE! Jake!  Jake, are you okay?
  Ahh, I can't stop dancing!|Wha--?
 It must be the glitter! Oh, I really can't stop groovin'! It feels weird! Go on without me!| YAAAAAAAAAH!
  YAAAAAAAAAH!|"""Freezed"" to meet you!"
" ""Freezed"" to meet you!"|Hope you saved room for dessert!
 Hope you saved room for dessert!|Killing you with ice cream!
  Whoo! Yeah, man!|Whoa!  Jake! There's one left... and I think he's trying to surrender.
 Kill it!|But he's dressed as a little construction worker! It's freakin' adorable.
  He's tryin' to trick you! Kill it!|I just don't know if I can bring myself to do it, Jake.
 Why, thank you, Finn and Jake, for sort of saving our village.|You're sort of welcome.
 Not so fast! I'll take it from here, folks. | He likes ice cream.
  He likes ice cream.|Haha, nice job, tubby. But save room for the Ice Cream Marathon.
  I've always got room for ice cream, Finn. You know that, man! Ugh, I'm going to the Ice Cream Marathon.| He just really likes ice cream.
  Huh, neat.| The Goblins have suffered long enough, Xergiok!
  Blah! |  Wands are for wimps! 
  | And stay out, Muffin Top!
  Nyaaar! Great job, warriors! You've freed us. I am Gummy, royal goblin chief of staff.| Nice to meet you. 
  Yeah, be their king.| No, man, I'm an adventurer for life.
  Please, Finn,  we need a king.| Stop the riot!
  Huh?| I'll become your king! To save y'all, from yourselves.
  Show me what we got, Gummy. Show it to me!  Dude! I'm psyched!| Hahaha, yeah!
  I'm being... born.| That's pretty neat.
  The Royal Dragon Stables.|  Whoa!
  I call top. | And I call...
  Wait! For you, great king, the Book of Royal Rules. | Hmmm. Sounds boring.
  Oh, no worries, my Liege. I'll read it to you.| Hey, Jake, want to stay awake and hear some rules?
  | Alright, lay it on me, Gummy.
  Your Excellency! Let's go. We have much to do! | Whoo!!
   This is where you may perform your daily processes, my king | Whoooaa!!!! Look at that huge mirror... and it's painted baby blue—boy style.
"  Come, sire, it is time to brush your teeth in the front of the ""boy style"" mirror. "| Whooo!!! Awesome! 
   Oh, no, no, no, Your Majesty! Let us brush your teeth|  Yaaaah!! Whoa, ease up, dudes. Finn access only.
  Spare them, Your Majesty! Spank me instead!  Set my buttocks ablaze!| Guys, what are you talking about?
  Rule 1| Oh! Oh. Guys, put your hams away.
  Whaa??| I'm not gonna spank your hams. I'm not that kind of king!
  So then... we may brush your teeth, my lord?| You can brush my teeth... I guess.
  Yaayyyy!!!!!! | This brunch looks great! Can't wait to dig in. 
  Uhhh, I will cut that, Your Highness.| Gummy, as king, I order you to let me cut it.
  I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it.| I'm cutting it, Gummy! 
  No! |  Thank you, Gummy.
  Uhhhhh, a thousand pardons, my lord. You're not going to chew that, are you?| Yeah.
  I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it.| Gummy, just let me do this. No one will know.
  I would know. | Uhhhhhh, Jake, this is nuts.
  Master, eat your food. I chewed thoroughly and heated it to goblin body temperature.| I'm not hungry, Gummy.
  You look a little bit down. Would you like me to weep for you?| No, Gummy. It's just.... 
  Sire, sire!!!! There's trouble in town square. A thief!!| A thief? Hahaha, yes! I'll handle it! 
  Give me them hot buns, lady!| Hey, thief!
  It's the new king. It's him! | I got a speech for you—
  Nooooooo!  The Royal Speaker must give the speech.| What.
  Yes, you can feel it slowly working, eh?|  I can't let this go on.  Hands off, thief!!
  | Ha!! Here you go, old lady. 
  Oh, no, the new king! Just as cruel as the last king.| I—you—what?
  Oh, king, we beg you not to slay the old lady.  Aaaah!!! | No, wait.
  We're ready  for our spankings, sire.|  ♪I just want to help y'all as much as I can, and y'all just keep showing me your goblin hams.  When I became king, I didn't think y'all would show me your rears, but I'll accept my boring fate, and shed this tear...  'cause I can't seem to cure you of your groundless fears.♪
  No. No more spankings...  Aaaahh!!!!| Gummy, don't be afraid. I'm gonna stick to the rules now, okay?
   Ohhh...|  If I defeat Xergiok as king, I can prove to the goblins that an active king can be a good king, but I can't let them know until it's all over. Stay fainted, Gummy.  Ooooooooh! Whisper Dan, have you seen Jake?
  I'm in here.| Xergiok's back with an army of Earclopses. Let's bust them up.
  pbbbbbbbbbbbbb. All right, man, how do we do this?| Hmmmmmmm. 
  What if they figure it out?| No way, man.
  Ohhhhh, too late—in my pants.| Jake, the goblins can't see me being unkingly. I need a disguise.
  Who among you has the courage to face Xergiok?| Shut your kissin' hole, Xergiok! It's time for a beatin'.
  I salute you, foolish warrior! You can be my personal sla—|  wowowowowowowowowoowowoow! 
  Hurrah!!! | C'mon, dude, lets get out of here.
   Alright. | Well, looks like they got the king they wanted, buddy.
  Yep.| And we're going home to adventure.
  Mmhmm.| High five us, dude.  Hey, Jake?
  Wha?| Why do the insides of you smell like vanilla?
  Ohh, uh, a wizard put a curse on me.| Huh, neat.
  Whoops. Hey, what's it supposed to be, anyway?| It's... a scale model of the Candy Kingdom, made out of my saliva! 
  ...Sooo this means you wanna give 'er your spit, huh?| Yup!  HEY, NO—
  It's okay, dude. I totally get it. Haw haw haw.| I just wanted to give 'er somethin', uh... to celebrate her science... thing.
  You mean her... Super Science Barbecue?!| You think it's science-y enough for 'er?
  Relax. She'll love it!  And then she'll love you. Heh heh heh...| Wha?!
  Oh. Hi, guys! Just gettin' the grill cookin' for tonight's BBQ!| Oh!
  What's that you got behind your back there, Finny?| Oh, I... I made you somethin'.
  Really? Can I scope it?| Yes. Close your eyes.
   A'ight.|  Get ready to open your eyes!
  Achoo!  Can I open my eyes?|  No, wait, uh, keep 'em closed for, like, three more hours!! 
  Hey... If you two aren't watching the grill, then who's watching the....  ...GRILL?!?!| MEAT!! WAH!!  DIE, YOU FIRE!!! 
   Finn! That was awesome.| Oh. Heh... Thanks, Princess. I'm always happy to help.
  I see. Your heroic brain is fascinating in a scientific way. Many scientific minds are going to be speaking at my barbeque. You should talk about something, too. You'll do that for me, right?|  Anything you want...
  Thanks, Finn!  Listen, I have to deal with this.  See you tonight?|  Uh... Yeah! 
   Buddy, just breathe into me.| Ah?
   You're just gonna give a speech to a buncha' brainiacs.| I can't hang with those guys. I'm full of stupid.
  Then we'll just borrow some brains by goin' to the place where knowledge liiives!| Oh, Brain Town!
  Uh, no, the library.|  The Library of the Undead...
  Hey, Finn, let's split. This turned out to be boring.| But I have to cram this info!
  Okay, okay... I'll just keep readin' this book about figs.| And I'll just read this book about pigs.
  Haha! Whatcha doin'?!| I'm bored now, too!
   Shh! Hey! That's completely inappropriate! | But... w-w-we were just enthusiastic about learning!
  But... w-w-we were just enthusiastic about learning!| Hmm... So, if I can't book-learn for beans, we'll just get some smarty to explain scientific junk to me!
  Yeah, then you can at least sound smart... but where're you gonna find someone like that?| Jake... we're goin' to college.
"  And the great question endures... ""Who would win in a battle between Nietzsche's Übermensch... and Mandroid?"" The answer is...  WEREWOLF QUEEN! IT'S ALWAYS WEREWOLF QUEEN!"|  Rad!
  Heh heh heh heh heh.| Jake. You can just shrink yourself down.
  And when I finally meet the Werewolf Queen, she will take me on as her royal consort and we will rule in blood!| Hey, teach. Can you talk more about scientific... uh... stuff and things?
  Well... sure, I could...  if this wasn't a class on THEORETICAL FIGHTONOMICS!|  Ohhh...
  Are you even in this class, Mister....| Uh... Wormy... uh, Wormy McSquirmy!
  Truancy hurts us all, McSquirmy!| Hey! Ow! Please! Where's your compassion?!
  Excelsior! | Jake, let's get outta here!  OW! 
   And stay out of Academia! |  Well... that's it. I'm all outta ideas on how to learn this junk.
  OH! Let's just solve this thing with magic!| No... That's the easy way out.
   Yeah. It's the easy way out!|  Oh! Oh, yeah! Let's go visit Choose Goose and his magical shack!
  Magic, you say?! | Yeah, Choose Goose! I need magic! Some kind of mind-enhancing magic.
  Ah, yes, the quest you are on, requires  the Glasses of Nerdicon!| So... I just put those on, and then I'd be able to give that lecture... and Princess Bubblegum will totally dig it. Yeah! Whadaya want for it, CG?
  Lately, I've been feeling drained. I only wish to be entertained.|  Hmm... Oh! 
  Well done! The glasses, you have won! |  Everything small is just a small version of something big!! I understand everything!!
  Whoa, bud, are you okay?| Oh, Jake... I'm better than okay. I know exactly how to impress the princess.
  More spit bubbles?| No. No. Those spit bubbles were as fragile as my old perception of reality. But wait! Maybe you're on to something! I could show the princess bubbles the likes of which no one has ever seen!!
  And how will you do that?| I'll start with a solid bulleted list!
   Thanks again to Dr. Dextrose for sharing your fascinating research on the future of cuteness.| Yes, yes, how charming. What... quaint notions.
  And now for a special guest lecture by one of Ooo's greatest heroes... Finn the Human!| Ladies and gentlemen... and princess...  I'm here to talk about multi-dimensional bubbles! But I'm not just going to talk about blowing bubbles! I'm going to blow... your... minds!
  Hmm?|  This is a bubble-blower of my own design. With this, you can blow bubbles in different dimensions.  This two-dimensional bubble casts a one-dimensional shadow.  A three-dimensional bubble casts a two-dimensional shadow.  A fourth-dimensional bubble casts a three-dimensional shadow... IT IS BEYOND COMPREHENSION!  Beyond space!! Beyond time!!
  Finn... that would mean you've created...| Yes... A BLACK HOLE!!!
  FINN!! DO SOMETHING!!| It's okay. I'm sure the solution is on my bulleted—  LIST!!  Don't worry. I have everything under control.
  YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL US ALL?!?| NO, OF COURSE NOT! I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE GREATEST CONFERENCE EVER!!!
  Finn...! You've gone insane!| What?! No way! I'm, like, the smartest guy in Ooo, thanks to these glasses!
  Glasses? Finn... take those off. You're not yourself!| But—
   Please!! I need the real you!| What's goin' on?!  WHOA!!!
  You blew it, Finn! With this! | Then I'll kill it... with this! 
  Be careful!  Finn!! Look out!!| Wha? Fourth-dimensional! Jake! Let me go!
  Finn!! Don't do anything stupid!!| I can't help it, man!!  I'm all about stupid!! YAAAAAAH!!! 
"  What's this?  ""Make hyper bubble. Cause black hole. Become insane. PB takes off the glasses. Save the day. Win the heart of the princess.""? Finn, you knew all this would happen?!"| Huh? Knew what? I wrote that list when I was insane with smartness!
 Ha ha! Yeah, he knows how to get things started.|Firepit number 1. Easy-peasy, livin' greasy! You wonder why they even put it there.
 It's probably a computel gleetch.|
 Now comes some real trouble! It's Bouncy Bee! He's gonna get that sun, man!|Haha! Please.  Bleep!
 |I had my eyes closed on that one!
 Yeah, that was cool. Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude, go back!|I ain't in it for the money, man. I'm in it to crush the enemies of the sun. Like this sloppy butt right here.
 Hunny Bunny!|I'm like, Hunny Bunny, don't you ever learn? I've always got the bomba! 
 Man, you are hot tonight! Think you can do it this time? Can you beat Sleepy Sam?!|Oh, I very can!
 Remember|Okay! Here goes.
 Spin, down, up, left, faster, dude! Right, left, down!|Aww! Every time!  BMO, this game is the worst! If we were really inside that game, man, we would crush Sleepy Sam. Breezily! With my mitts!
 Oh no! It's much more dangerous than you think!|Whoa, whoa, wait!
 If I push this button, you will both be dangerously transported into my main brain game frame where it is very dangerous!|Oh, man. Oh, BMO! You gotta let us in that game!
 No! It's a far too dangerous incredible adventure for you! It's final.|Oh. Okay, BMO. Well, time for bed!
 ...Finn?|Time for bed. Right, Jake? 
 ...oh, right! Heh heh. Good night, BMO.  Time for bed! |We're in the game!
 Look! There's the sunshine we gotta protect!  And there's a hole we're supposed to go down!  And there's you...doing whatever you're doing. | I'm looking at my bits! My leg is math!
  Mmm. That sunshine feels good. Feels good all over!| No wonder all the monsters in this game want to get their grubby mitts on it! Let's go kick their digital bootays!  Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo doo! Doo!
   Beep boop! Beep boop!| ♫ We are in the computer world. We're computer boys, not computer girls. ♫
  ♫ In a game, I can be who I virtually am. ♫| ♫ I can walk and sing, I can kill Silly Sam! ♫
   Hey, what stinks?  Smells like...| Pit!  Looks a mite bigger inside the game...
  Jumpin' over this pit is easy, remember? We could do this backwards with our eyes closed!  Ahh! I'm burning!| Jake!!
  Haha. What, man?| Whaa?! Jake, what the shake?
  Check it out! Extra lives!| You still have two left!
   Ow! It burns! Ow! Haha!| Jake!
  | Dude! What if losing all your lives in here makes you die in real life? Or worse?!
  ...that makes me just want to sit here and feel bad.| No way, man! We're gonna cross that hole! With real-world grit! Come on!
  No way, man! We're gonna cross that hole! With real-world grit! Come on!| Faster, Jake! Get ready to stretch it!
  Faster, Jake! Get ready to stretch it!| Watch out, Jake! 
  Ow! Whew! That was pretty intense, dude!| We're pretty intense dudes!
  Yeah! | Ha!
  What's that sound?| Sounds like... 
  Whoa!| Hi-yah!  Oh! 
  Finn's dead! Finn! No!  Why?  NO!!! Curse this false virtual world!  Oh, Finn!| Yo, what up?
  Oh, Finn! You're alive! | Yeah. I got extra lives, man!
  Oh my gosh. Let's never die again! There's nothing more precious than a life! Ooh, dude, look. Coins! Oh man, oh man!  Heeheehee!  Ooh! Oh, man, dude, these coins are thick! Let's take 'em back to the real world! We'll be filthy stinkin' rich!| Whoa!
  No!| Time to use the bomba!  Come to me, bomba.  Bomba!  Oh, bomba! I can't select you without my controller!
  Let's get outta here, Finn!| Man, we've never run away from Hunny Bunny!
  Man, we've never run away from Hunny Bunny!| Firepit, Bouncy Bee, Hunny Bunny. They're supposed to be the easy parts! They're all hard as butts! Sleepy Sam is gonna be the ultimate butt-kicker!
  Look, Finn. The most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin.| Man, get a hold of your brains! We need to stay alert for Sleepy Sam!
  Hey, that's him right there! | Get down!  What's he doing? He's probably trying to psych me out!  I'm gonna break you, Sam. When I'm done, they'll call you...uh, Stinky Sam. Stupid Frog.
  Get down!  What's he doing? He's probably trying to psych me out!  I'm gonna break you, Sam. When I'm done, they'll call you...uh, Stinky Sam. Stupid Frog.|  M-m-my mitts didn't- didn't work! Come on, help me punch him!
  Let's get outta here, man! We're gonna die!| I can see the light! We're almost there!
  I can see the light! We're almost there!| Oh no, man. It's the edge of the screen! We're trapped and they'll be here any second.
  Wait, dude! The bomba!| We can't get the bomba!
  Wait, dude.  Hmm.| Jake? Jake!
  What if I...? | That's not how it works!
  That's not how it works!| Jake, let go of that!
   Did you have to- oh no! Wait! Run!| No, no, no! Don't kill us, man! No!
  Alright! See ya later, Sam! |  You mean, that's it? You're not gonna kill us?
   Of course not. The game's over; we won! All we wanted was the sunshine. And to kill that computer that's been imprisoning us for so many years.| ...what?
  Oh sure. He's dangerous! If he hits his button again, back we go.| BMO, quick! Hit your button!
  They're too strong! Use the combo move, Finn! The combo- | The combo move? That never works!
  Listen! You got this, man! I know you-  I know you can do it, buddy! You got this! |  Okay, okay. You got this, Finn! For your friends!  Up! Down! Left! Left! Right! Right! Down! Spin! Down! Up! Left! Right! Left! Down! Spin! Up! Down! Jump!!
   Okay, okay. You got this, Finn! For your friends!  Up! Down! Left! Left! Right! Right! Down! Spin! Down! Up! Left! Right! Left! Down! Spin! Up! Down! Jump!!| Whoa.
  Woohoo!  You did it, Finn! I knew you had the stuff! Right, BMO?| Oh, crud!
  BMO!| I'm sorry, buddy!
  Finn, I told you about the danger! And now look! You fricasseed my stuff and broke our house all up!| I know, I know. I was double butt. For real.  Man! Now that we know what to expect, next time will be way more fun!
  Yeah, yeah!| How 'bout it, BMO? You in?
  | Hey! Don't do the combo move on us!
  We were only joking!| BMO! Stop messing around!
   Ah fudge! What time is it? I gotta go to Veggie Village for the Annual Technology Fair. Will y’all watch my Princess Plant for me?  I usually hire a sitter but- Ehn!| Of course, Princess!
  Awesome! Thank you, Finn. I will be back on the Morrow. SCREEEEEEEE!| You’re in good hands, Princess Plant.
  You’re in good hands, Princess Plant.| And then the monster got punched in the head and the princess was safe. And everyone was happy!
  And then the monster got punched in the head and the princess was safe. And everyone was happy!| 
  Yeah. Time to make sleepies!| Ahhh. We killed it, man!
  I know!| Okay.  All we gotta do, is go to the Land of the Dead and reclaim the flower’s soul from death before Bubblegum returns.
  Excuse me, but did you all say Land of the Dead?| Oh, what?! Oh, uh… yeah.
  I can take you.| Really?
  Uh… okay.| Thanks Peppermint Butler. 
  So… um… you wanna…  hop in my paunch and I’ll stretch us down?| Uh… Oh look, an escalator!
   Hey, dude.| That must be the main entrance or some biz!
  Let’s go!| Holy schmow!
  How did you die?| Uh…
  Hmm… Step out of line. | Awh dingle!
   Man…| Yes!
  Yes!| Where do we go now, dude?
  Death’s castle is pretty, dude.| Let’s go! 
  Whoo! You don’t know what you’re doing to me, guy! Fellas get over here! Flesh!|  This is weird, man.
  Don’t worry! They just think we’re cool!| Hmm… Do you guys think we’re cool?
  No. We’re gonna rip that flesh off you! And eat it!| It’s bone-kicking time! 
  | Oh shoot! Get- 
  Oh shoot! Get- | Jake! There’s too many!
   They’re tryin’ to peel me!  I… am not… a banana!  Hole! | It’s not a hole, Jake! It’s just a divot!
  Oh! Sorry.| I don’t like the underworld too much.
  I don’t know. Wouldn’t be so bad if there weren’t folks trying to eat our skin.| I wonder how Princess Bubblegum is doing.
  So! Who here invented this thing?| I’m glad she’s not coming back ‘till tomorrow.
"  No she said she’s coming back ""on the Morrow."""| Yeah, on the ‘morrow. That means tomorrow.
  No man, the Morrow is her bird!| Come again?
  It’s her bird! That thing is crazy fast! It’ll only take like twenty minutes to get back once that conference is over.  Are you listening, man?  The Morrow, is a bird. | We gotta go!  Coast is clear!
  Ooh! You’re a smart guy, Halt!|  Wait, Jake! Do you hear somethin’? Come on! 
   I didn’t see them… They were here, and now they’re gone!...| More skeletons! We’ve gotta be really, really quiet!
  Get em!| Jake!
  Ahh!|  Look! There’s Death’s castle!
   Look! There’s Death’s castle!|  I don’t see anyone. I guess you double-killed them with that avalanche.
  Heh, awesome!| Now we just gotta cross that river!
 Yes…  Drink the water…| Whoa, okay Jake, don’t drink the water!
  Come one! I’m so thirsty!| Dude! That skull wants you to drink the water! It’s bad water!
  See? That means good right? | Jake…
  Jake…| Jake? Why you makin’ stupid face?
  Who’s Jake?| Dang it, I knew that water was junk!
 Tricked again by the River of Forgetfulness!| Jake! Get out of that water right now!
  Hey! Hey! I see you!| Jake! Your head!
  Well, I didn’t know!| Dang it, Jake.
  You must leave this place. Now!|  Death! We’re not leaving until our plant’s soul! And Jake’s memory!
  Another one. Be gone, mortal!| No! I promised Princess Bubblegum!  Oof! Oww… What happened?
  You can’t kick me because your brain is stupid!| Your brain is stupid!
   Alright.  Pick an instrument.| Huh?
   To get stuff from me, you have to beat me in a musical battle.| But Jake’s the musical one! And he’s got poo brain!
   I don’t care.| I gotta find what I can really play! Oh glob, man!  Oh! Here we go!  Sleigh bells! YA WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!
"  Oh, man! Skeleton guy by a landslide! He was like ""Rughhh,"" he was like ."| Dude!
  What? Skeleton guy was awesome! You want me to lie?| Yes! 
  I’m going to kill you now.| No! I still have to rescue stuff!
   Those are the rules in the Land of the Dead. Lose a music battle, lose your life. | Oh wait, wait, wait! Before I die, I’m honor-bound to tell you... Peppermint Butler says hi.
   What? You know Peppermint Butler?!| Yeah!
   Ahem. Mr. Finn, Mr. Jake, I believe you still owe me something in exchange for that favor I did.| Sure!
 And here at this site, my Great Uncle Gumbald cut down all these taffy trees in a single night.|'Cause those trees were evil... right, Princess Bubblegum?
 Nah. Hey, but I bet they have a ton of stories about your human relatives.|Um... not really. I've never even met any other humans. If I think about it too much, I get all soul-searchy and weeeeiiirrrd...
  Ohhh, boy... I've made things awkward. Well, let's forget about that. I brought you guys here because I need you to rip out all these stumps!| Okay... I guess so...
 Yeah, man, it'll be fun!  Toss the Jake-sploder!  Nyeeeeh, boom!| SPA-MOW!!
 Again, man!| Huck!
 Ow!! Whoa... I don't think this is a stump.| Huh?  It's a hatch.
 A hatch?  We should check it out, ya think?!   Waaah!|Heh-heh.  S'dark, huh?  Whooooooaaaaaa!
 What a dump!  Can you imagine the jerks that musta lived here?| Huh?!
 SHAHOW!!   O my gra cup-ssah! |These people are so terrified... Scared of their own shadows...
 We could rule them... like gods!  ...Angry gods...| Don't be scared, c'mon.  Yeah, it's okay.  Your... your face! You're...  JUST LIKE ME!!  Hey, wait!
  Shh. They're startled. Ya gotta be gentle with wild animals.|I don't think they're animals, Jake. I think... this could be... a tribe of... humans!!  What are these guys doing down here in this crummy hole?
 I don't know, man. Maybe they just don't know any other thing.| Hey, fellows! Don't you wanna get out of here?! I could take you to see the sun!  Suuuun. Suuuun.
 Suhhhn... Ow la koo sow suhn. |You poor things... Living down here has made you all weird, hasn't it?  Jake, I've got to save these guys! They're my people, and it's my duty to lead them outta this gross cave! Starting with you, Miss, uh... 
 Suuhh... suhhhn... |...Susan?  Pleased to meet you!
 Well, let's bring 'er up!| C'mon.
  C'mon.|Aw, man, you're gonna love it up here, Susan!

 Golden as a wheaty sunset! How's yours?| Hmmm...  Perfect!  How's yours, Susan?
 Dang... She is way into candy.|Hey, yeah! Susan! We should take you to the Candy Kingdom! Everything is candy there!
 You know, she may be too excited about candy.| Nah...

  Finn, where's all the candy yuh werp talk ah bout?! |Oh, well, it's... everywhere! The buildings, the lamp posts, even the people!
  CANDY! CANDY! |Susan!  Susan!! No! You can't eat the ones that talk! They're special! They got aspirations. 
  Ohh-ho. |It's okay. You're learnin'. Here.  Have some sidewalk brittle instead. 
 Mmm!  Now, I gonna get friends. We eat all of Candy Kingdom.| What?!
 Oh. No, no, no, no, no. We won't eat red stripe man. Only everyone else.  Bye!|Susan, no!!  No!!! You can't eat the Candy People!!  Oh, boy...
 So now what? Fight the humans to the death when they attack?|No, man! They're my peeps! We have to save the Candy Kingdom without hurting them.
 They're gonna what?!|Don't worry! We have a plan! We just have to scare the humans away!
 Good news, Finn! I've managed to make my people horrifying!|But how?! 
 Aw, so cute! I just wanna give them candy!| Quick! Show me your scary face!!
 I don't think that'll scare anybody...|NO DUH! She's...um...! She's...  Hey! Princess. I need a little wagon and your biggest roll of wax paper.
 NO DUH! She's...um...! She's...  Hey! Princess. I need a little wagon and your biggest roll of wax paper.|Now, Princess Bubblegum!  Now, Jake!  It's working...
  Wah!! Just shadows!|Aw, man! They've learned how to learn! Hide yourselves, Candy People! I'll try to make Susan see reason!
 The Marshmallow Kids never run from a scrap!  Come on, fellas!  Today... we are man-mallows!  Huh? |Please, fellow humans! The Candy People are no threat to you!
 CHARGE!!!|WAIT!! STOP!!
 DUCK!!|MY PEOPLE!!  HUH?!?!  WHA?!?  They're... they're not humans?  Susan?  Susan... what are you??
 MY PEOPLE!!  HUH?!?!  WHA?!?  They're... they're not humans?  Susan?  Susan... what are you??|Is everyone okay?  Marshmallow Kids?
  Hey, buddy! We did it! Finn? You okay?|Jake, do you think she was human, or just another wild animal?
  We're all wild animals, brother.| Yeah... I guess we are... brother.
  Happy birthday!| Jake! Is that you? I can't see! 
  Right! That's because-| I'm blind?! Jake! I'm blind on my birthday!
  No dude, you're blindfolded.|  Oh...
   Surprise!|  Orange blindfold? That is a surprise!
  That's not the surprise. This is!| You got me a train?  Thank you, Jake!
   This isn't the gift!| Huh?
  We have to take the train to get to the gift.| Oh. Almost as cool as a free train! 
  I'll go get the tickets.| Okay!
  Oh? Climb aboard my train, little boy, you're my new friend. He hehe hehehe.  All aboard! | This is gonna be the best birthday ever!
   Found a schedule!| Great! Now find your seatbelt.
  Colonel, I am so sorry.| Hey! We're in the straight-away!
  I'm gonna kill you!| A skeleton...  Is he going to be okay, Doctor Donut?
  Hey man, this is kinda a bad scene. Maybe we should get off the train and huff it to your surprise.| Are you kidding? It's a murder mystery! On a train!  And we're gonna solve it.
   Alright.| What'dya think, Doctor Donut? Any clues?
  No, no! It wasn't me, I swear!| Passengers, passengers! I don't think it was Colonel Candy Corn.
  Thank you!| No, in murder mysteries it's never the first person you think of. Never ever.
  So who do you think it is?|  Colonel, do you have any enemies on this train?
  Just one! And his or her name is...| See? I knew it wasn't him!  But now we need to figure out who his enemy is. It could be anybody.
  It could even be you.| Yes it could.  Except I didn't do it.
  But... we don't know that.|  You singled me out to take suspicion of yourself! Are you Colonel Candy Corn's enemy?
  What? No! I was just trying to join in on the conversation!|  Suspect numero uno!
   Suspect numero uno!| Rat traps! Really thought I was onto something!
  Now I know this is going to sound crazy, but what about the conductor?| No it's definitely not him.
   Oh. Why not?| 'Cause he's weird and creepy. And you never suspect the creepy guy because he's too obvious.
  Whatever, man. I'm gonna go sit and look at the schedule. | We're running out of suspects. And we're running out of time.
  Attention!  Attention passengers!  Nollie, heheheh. Yeah hi, it's me, the conductor. Heheh. Anyway, I couldn't help overhearing that someone thinks I'm weird and creepy. And you know; I'm not weird and creepy.  I'm cool and awesome.  Happy birthday, Finn. | Hey Jake.
  Yeeeeeeeaaah?| The conductor was just here and he was weirder and creepier then before.
  What?! No way, he was cool and awesome!| Anyway, it's still not him. ] No. The murderer is right here among us. ] Isn't that right, Doctor?
   You think it was me?| When Candy Cane guy was murdered, you diverted suspicion to Colonel Candy Corn.  Then killed him to protect your alibi.
  Dude, I think you're waaay off.| Am I? Or am I way on.
  Am I? Or am I way on.| Son of a-
  What'dya think we should do?| Hmmm... We need hard  evidence!
  Hmmm... We need hard  evidence!| Ha!  A basket of eggs, fish and cabbage!
  Ha!  A basket of eggs, fish and cabbage!| It's a receipt! From an earlier train ride. From another train!
  It's a receipt! From an earlier train ride. From another train!| Jake! I found a book! It's a dictionary!
  Jake! I found a book! It's a dictionary!| It's sheet music! 
  It's sheet music! | It doesn't make any sense to me. 
  Me neither!  Maybe the murderer is just too smart for us.| Yes! Jake, that's it! It's all so clear now! Gather everyone in the caboose and I will reveal a murderer!
  Yes! Jake, that's it! It's all so clear now! Gather everyone in the caboose and I will reveal a murderer!| You're the only remaining passengers. So the murderer, is in this caboose. 
  You're the only remaining passengers. So the murderer, is in this caboose. | Let me explain how I know who the murderer is.  I saw Pineapple Guy skim through the sheet music. Sheet music to a song that's very special to Lollipop Girl. A song that reminds her of Ice Cream Guy.   Before Colonel Candy Corn's aide, Doctor Ice Cream was in possession of a basket of cabbage, fish and eggs.  And you, Pineapple Guy, have cabbage bits on your socks!  And you!  Chocolate Bar Guy!  Does this dictionary look familiar? A dictionary that contains the words  Rid!  Guests!  At once!

  But the real murderer is someone no one suspects! The real murderer is-| No one was the murderer?!
  The conductor's still on the train!| Oh yeah! He did it.
  Yay, you did it, you solved it, Finn!| I knew it; because he's creepy.
  What?! Humpf.| I know. You knew he was the murderer all along. I couldn't have done it without  you, you, you 
  Thank you.| We make a great team, pal.
  We make a great team, pal.| You feel kinda bony.  Jake?  NOOOOOOOOOOO!
  Hey.| How could you murder all those Candy People?! And, you murdered Jake on my birthday! 
  Yes, and you're next.|  Wrong!
   Wrong!|I'm coming for you!  This is for Jake!  You're going down, or both of us are going down!  My birthday wish, is vengeance!  Happy birthday to me!!
  Wait! [Stretches himself around to reveal that it is actually Jake covered in paint.|  You're alive!!  You were the conductor the whole time?!
   Yup. You were so focused on the murders because you never even noticed!  The skeletons were the hardest part.  It was all an elaborate set up for your birthday present!| So nobody was murdered?
  Dude, open your eyes!| Hey, we're alive!
  -to you!| Wow, this is the best birthday ever. Thanks, Jake.
  You deserve it, buddy.  Because you're a great friend.| I think my favorite part was landing on the Gelatin. That musta taken forever to plan. 
  Nope! That part was a total accident.| Oh. So we could have...
  Hey, man, it's Couples Only Movie Night tonight. Who are you bringin'?| I don't know. Who are you bringin'?
  I'm bringing my girlfriend, dude.| Oh.
  Oh.| I'll take this duck!
  It's couples night! You gotta bring someone you can smooch.| Man, I don't want to be smooched!
  Don't have to smooch. You just have to bring someone you can smooch. It's, like, the rules.| Lame.  Ah! Well, I'll take this blanket! 
  You all square?| Yeah, yeah.
  Who you gonna call?| I'm going to call a girl I don't have to kiss. 
   Hello?| Hi Princess! Would you go to Couples Movie Night with me?
  Sounds romantic, Finn.| No! I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me. 
  No, sorry, Finn. I'm busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship.| But—
"  Auf Wiedersehen! (""Goodbye"")"| She doesn't want to go!
  Yes she does! We just need to help her realize that she wants to go to the movies with you.  I'm calling Marceline.| What?
  Hey, hey, Marceline. Got a favor to ask, Babe. We've gotta make Princess Bubblegum jealous, so she'll go to the movies with Finn.  Marceline? Come in. Hello? | Hehe. Are you gonna help us?
  Okay, so here's the plan.  You start saying things and  you start laughing waaay loud. And then Bubblegum...  will get jealous of you . Which will awaken her Finn love! You start us off.| Um... hmm funny... funny... giddy up?
  Um... hmm funny... funny... giddy up?| Hehe. Um... diggy diggy?
  Hehe. Um... diggy diggy?| Diggy diggy!  Diggy diggy!
   Yeah, yeah. So, what's so funny, Finn?| I, um... uh... it's... something.
  Hey, look, Finn, I know Jake's your friend and all, but... if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've gotta like, stop taking advice from your dog and take some advice from a real girl!| But Jake said Phase 2 is powerful!
   How is Jake going to know what girls want more than a real girl?| Yeah...
  Okay great. So what we need now is something... fun! Girls love fun more than anything. Fun, fun, fun! If you can show Princess Bubblegum you're fun, she'll deffs wanna go to the movies with you.| Haha, you said fun so much, it sounds all weird now. Fun. F—
  So... what do you like to do for fun, Finn?| Oh, Oh! I like to wrestle! And fight!  But girls don't like that.
  No, no, that's perfect! All you need to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum to show her how fun you are. | Ffffffuuunnn. Ffffuuunn. 
  Whoa, where you going, man? Check it out!| What is that stuff?
  What she talking about, Finn?| Well... I was going to give Marceline's plan a try, too.
   Oh, hey, Finn! Did'ya ever find some—Whoa! What are you wearing?| Oh... this is my... Lute... suit.
  Oh... this is my... Lute... suit.| Oh.  This is my lute-suit!
  Psst! | Oh, yeah!  So... Headlock! 
  Ridi—Ridiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can ya?| Uh... I guess the suit did feel... a little silly.
  Well, fine! You can just give it back then!| I'm sorry!
  Gee, he seems pretty ticked.| Naw, he just needs some spaghetti.
  Oh, okay. Well taste this, then. I've gotta a new plan.| Really?
  The only thing women like more than fun is excitement! She needs to feel her blood pump, man! She needs to... be chased by wolves!| Like metaphorically?
  Come on, I'll teach ya how to show a girl a good time. Wraps Finn's arms around her.] Hold tight. You ready?| Uhh...  Mhmm.
  Shhh! She's probably asleep!| This was a really good idea.
   Now don't blow it this time!| Haha, okay.
  Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here! There's wolves in my room!| Yeah, I know! I put them there! Pretty exciting, right? Heh heh.
   I'm sorry to do this, Finn. But until you stop acting like a psycho, you're forbidden from entering the Candy Kingdom. Farewell. | I don't understand, Marceline. I tried everything. I guess she just doesn't like me. 
  Shhh. Come on, Finn, a brainlord like Bonnie? You'll be bored with her in a week! And anyway I, for one, think you're pretty great.  Sorry it didn't work out the way you wanted. See you later, I guess! | Marceline! Of course! It's been Marceline all along!
  Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti?| Ah, no, thanks, man. But I really need your help!
  Uh-oh.| Marceline! Will you go to the movies with me?!
  We need to talk...|  Good evening my dear, your escort is here!
  Finn, you do NOT want to go down that road with me.| With you, I would walk down any road, m'lady. Especially, if it leads to the movies.
  Oh, yeah? No one would want to go to the movies with...  this!  What do you think of me now?| How do you like your popcorn?
  Uuugh!  You're starting to annoy me!| Well then let's do something fun, like go to the movies!
  Get off me!  Finn, I like you, but I—| Headlock! 
  I'm sorry Finn, I just... I don't wanna date you.| Date me? Man, I just wanna go to the movies. But everybody hates me.
  Wait, you don't want me to be your girlfriend?| Huh? No! Movies!
  If you weren't looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day?| 'Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else.
  Of course I'll go with you, Finn!| You will?
  Yeah, as friends.| Of course as friends!
  But no tongue.| Yea—Wha?
 | Oh, man! I can't believe I'm finally going to see this movie!
  No, not goodbye. Let's say| Couples Night sucks! Marceline, would you do me the honor, of getting the plop out of here?
  Hey, Jake.  Wait up!|  What's shakin'?
  I-I don't know. I think I'm still asleep| What if I'm still asleep?
  Then we're sharin' the same dream, dude.  Look out your window!| Aah! Dream monster!
  Aah! Dream monster!| Quick, let's go enjoy this dream before we wake up!
  Whoaaaaa!| ...  Dreamy, dream, dream...
   Hey, man, I don't think this is a dream.| Hmm? 
  Hmm? | Oh, well, then it's time to get real. 
  Help! Somebody help! Help! Help me! Help me!| The monster ate somebody! We have to go inside its guts!
  Help! Somebody help!| Hyup! 
  Ohhhhh. It's gross!| 
  Help!|  C'mon!
  It's not a party without streamers! ♫ Doot-doot-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo ♪| Dude, this isn't a party! We gotta get you outta here!
  Dude, this isn't a party! We gotta get you outta here!| Jake, help me!
  It's starting!  Hehehehehehe!| These crazy bears don't know they're in danger!
  Well... we should go.| Jake, wait. We have to help them.
  They're partying! They're fine.|  Okay, Jake, what happens when you eat food?
  Well, it goes into your stomach...| Yeah...?
  ...and then it stays there for a bit, and then it turns into— They're all gonna turn into... the stuff!|   Hey, excuse me! Excuse me! I don't know how you don't know this, but y'all are partyin' in a monster's stomach!
  Thanks! I love dancing!| No!  Y'ALL... are PARTYIN'... in a MONSTER'S... STOMACH!
  I'm Cubby.| Hi, Cubby.
  I heard what you said... about this being a monster's belly? I've been telling everyone that for three days!| Why won't they listen?
  Hmm... | Cubby, is there anything we can do to help?
  You could talk to Party Pat.| Party Pat?
  He's our chief. If you can convince him to leave, all will follow.| Can you take us to him?
  This is as far as I go. Party Pat is right around this corner. Bye, you guys!| Bye, Cubby!
  Bye!| Uhh... we're lookin' for Party Pat?
  Uhh... we're lookin' for Party Pat?| Oh, uh...  Well, listen. I know you don't know us, sir, but we need to talk.
  | It's pretty important, actually—
   Shhh-sh-sh-sh-shhhh. You know who I am?| You're Party Pat?
   I'm the chief.| Riiiight... right.
   Shhhh... before you talk to the chief, you must party with the chief.| But—!
  Dude, we've been partyin' for hours.|  Yeah, he keeps drinking those honey-flavored energy drinks.
   Yeah, he keeps drinking those honey-flavored energy drinks.| How's your nausea?
  Full-blown.| Hang in there, pal.  Hey, Party Pat. You're the chief, and I totes respect that... but what we have to tell you is really important. And you said if we partied, we could talk.
  But you haven't been partying.| What?!
  You move to music, but that's not dancing. You chew pancakes, but you're not tasting. To truly party, one must leave behind the problems that are troubling  and open one's  mind eye.  I'm just kiddin'. You guys are party animals.  This is just a sticker!  You can stay in our cave as long as you want.| That's what I've been trying to tell you, man! This isn't a cave—y'all are partyin' in a monster's BELLY!
   Oh, yeah. That makes sense. It's definitely the weirdest cave I've ever seen. Heh heh.| So... you'll tell everyone to leave?
  Nah, we love it here.| But you're all gonna die if you stay!
  | All those bears... are gonna turn into the stuff.
   Shh. Seriously? The only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed, but they're not hurtin' nothin'.| Yeah, good thing he isn't swallowing some deadly volcano lava. That would kill them for sure.
  Whoaa.| The monster is headed toward that volcano!
  Uh-huh.| We gotta warn the bears!
  We gotta warn the bears!| If we bum everyone out, maybe they'll listen to us.
  Oh, okay.| Just follow my lead.
  Just follow my lead.| You bears gotta get outta here or you're all gonna be melted by lava!
  You bears gotta get outta here or you're all gonna be melted by lava!| Party Pat, do you know of another exit?
  Well, there's the dark and mysterious mine, but nobody uses it anymore.|  He must be talkin' about the butt intestines! C'mon, Jake, we gotta get outta here!
  One more bandage.| Huzzah! The party bears are safe, Party Pat. Y'all can party out here now.
  You're sick, Party Pat. I'm gonna go watch TV. | Hmmm. 
   Ohh...| Pat, he's not gonna let you back in his mouth. You scorched it all up with fireworks! Unless... Party Pat!  Party... pancakes.
    Hear me, monster. My people and I wish to party inside you once more. Prithee take us upon thine gut and we shall party no more with fireworks but instead  with gentle lasers!| Hey, Jake.  Wait up!
   Dude! Shooting star! Make a wish!|  That's not a shooting star.  It's just a firefly.
   That's not a shooting star.  It's just a firefly.| What are you gonna wish for dude?
  Oh, you know. That something special only two bros can share.|  I think I'm wishing for the same thing!
  Oh, man I wanna ride it so bad!| How do you even control those things?
  You can't control it dude. You have to let it give you control.| Oh wow!

   Yoga balls aren't that really huge, dude.| Hey, man, I can't analyze everything that comes out of my mouth.
   Should we like, try to cheat and stretch over the walls?| Nah, man. Look.
  Okay, well... then... I'll just hook my legs around this stump and stretch us through so we don't get lost. Like this, see? |  You're a cool guy, Jake. 
  Thank you.| Man, there're so many passage ways and stuff. It'll take us forever to find those Hot Dog Kni-iights?
  How didn't you guys get lost?| We're just gonna follow Jake's body back.
  At the centre of the maze, there's a magic creature that grants wishes.| Wishes?  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
  Choo-choo. |  Dang, Jake. Your body's getting thin!
  Yeah, I got a nice bod!| Yeah, but now...  not so nice.
  TRESPASSERS! | Wrap 'im up, Jake!
  Jake, you're amazing.| Jake, you need to take it easy on the stretching, man.
  Just gotta keep stretchin'.| Uh, yeah.  Wait! Stop, Jake. Ya hear that?
  No.| This place is weirding me out. Keep your eyes open for traps and junk.
  Whoa! Check that out!| Oh, snap! That's you dude.
  Hmm.|  Boop.
  Hey, man. Watch it. I think that's my nerp, but like super stretched out.|  Boop boop. Boop boop boop boop boop.
   NERP!| Oh my Grob! 
   It's okay, hot dogs are immune to poison.| Sick!
   Alright, you guys, hop on!  Let's do it.|  I don't think this is a good idea, man.
   I'm fine, brother. We'll have that war elephant in no time!| Ah, uh, okay...
  Ah, uh, okay...|  Woah!  Hmm, looks like the final puzzle. You think you can stretch up there, buddy.
   Yes.|  Whoa! Jake, you okay?!
  Huh, yeah, I just... can't close my eyes... lids... too tight.|  Okay, dude this is too far! No more maze, we're going home.
  Ah, alright.| Jake, no! You're gonna get hurt.
   I'm goin' for it!| Jake, no!
   Done!| That must be the wishes!
   Kitty!| You did it, man. No we can go wish for a...
  Ow! Ooh!|  JAKE! 
  My insides are all mashed up!| I knew we should have turned back!
  Actually, I'll do anything you guys want if you say my name three times. | Just hang tight, buddy. I'll use my wish to save you.
  Here we go!  Ooh.|  No! Jake is all jacked up.
  Then how else can we get wishes?!| Jake! Get up and carry us across!
  Yeaargh! That's it, I'm dead. | Jake! Stay with me, man!
  Nah.| But we did it, okay! I can wish you out of here, man!
  Oh yes, now you may each receive your wishes. For real!  But be warned. There are no do overs!| Okay,  So you guys should wish to get your buddies back, right?
  And I wish to blow up! I mean like get big! | Wow, you guys are really stupid.
  Huh?| Jake! Wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant! Then I'll wish to save you!
  Right. So hard to think on an empty stomach. I wish I wasn't so hungry. | You wasted your wish, man!
  I know. You should wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. It's what we wanted.| That's crazy, man! I gotta save your life.
  Do it... for... me!| I... wish... for... the Ancient PSYCHIC TANDEM WAR ELEPHANT!
  It has to give you control! Remember!| I'm on it.  Rah!  Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. HEAR ME!
   Finn the Human! Are you worthy to command me? |  You know I am, because you're psychic!  Now wish for my friends to be healed!
  No! You weren't supposed to have your wishes come true!  You were supposed to die!| Now, bust us outta here!
  No! | Yeah, boyyy!
  Don't forget LSP's diet cola.| I won't. I really do love Finn and Jake Movie Club.
  I won't. I really do love Finn and Jake Movie Club.| Okay, everybody. Apple juice for Tree Trunks.  Diet soda for LSP.
   Ehh.| What did you order, PB?
  Oh, I brought my own. | Huh.
  Ice latte for my lady. | Tomato juice for Marceline. 
  Thanks, Finn.| Hot cocoa for BMO.
   This does compute.| And finally, a thimble of milk for Shelby, the worm who lives in Jake's viola.
  You can just call me Shelby.| Jake...
  Princess Bubblegum's in my seat.| We decided last time
  What's that?| Just stuff that comes at the beginning of the movies.
  I don't know. It seems pretty important, Finn.| Alright, let's take a look.
"  ""Warning. Federal law provides severe and criminal penalties for the unauthorized exhibition of copyrighted motion pictures."""| Alright, well, goodbye.
  Sorry we had to cancel. | We've been showing these films unauthorized.
  But these movies are before the Great Mushroom War.| We should still respect authority, mang.
  We should still respect authority, mang.| Yeah?
  Are we meeting next week to watch a movie?| Uhh... Uh, yeah. Maybe. I think so.
"  아, 너무 좋았는데. (""Oh, I enjoyed that so much!"")"| Calm down, y'all. We're gonna have Finn and Jake Movie Club next week for sure. Jake and I just have to find a movie without that warning.
  Dude, we've never found a movie without that warning.| We're not gonna find a movie, Jake.
  Well, what are we gonna do?|  We're gonna make one!
  Movie filming time!| Okay, BMO. Turn to your right, and start filming.
  Huh?| That was awesome, BMO.
  Don't lose her, BMO!| Front shot! Front shot! Film the clouds. Don't forget the little one.
  Oh, we're gonna miss it. Hurry, BMO!| Don't lose it. Oh, it looks like it's gonna fall. Follow it!
  Look over there. Across the river.| BMO, forget about the coin. Film that over there!
  BMO, forget about the coin. Film that over there!| Zoom in.  Weird. Let's get some more footage.
  That's even better!| Uhh, what do you think?
  I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk.| Yeah, I'm not engaged. I need to see something that reflects life as it is, but, you know, entertaining.
  Yeah, like a romantic comedy.| Exactly. An action adventure.
  Wait, that's not what I said.| Let's get to filming!
  Let's get to filming!|  Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine, swim over the crocodiles, do a triple flip with a full twist and land clean. Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive. Action!
   Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine, swim over the crocodiles, do a triple flip with a full twist and land clean. Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive. Action!| No! No smooching! Cut.
  I thought it was great.| No, we can't use any of it.
  I think we should use all of it.| No, not all. We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smoochin'. That was dumb.
  What?| Duuuumb-ah. 
  Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut, that was not what I wanted!| That was awesome! We need to shoot more stuff like that.
   What's next?| Okay PB, move back a little.  Stop. 
  Finn.| Yeah.
  How does this work?| Umm, Jake's gonna get the frog to hop toward him  and when he does, you're gonna run along side the chariot and it's gonna look like you're driving it.
  Hey, Finn.| Yeah.
"  How 'bout when the chariot takes off, she says something like, ""Mmm, check, please."""| What? No, that's terrible.  And action!
  Check, please...?| Hah, Jake. You... you brought the fly in too close!
  I'm sorry.| Well, help me catch 'im.
  Well, I thought it was funny.| This isn't a comedy!
  Not the way you're shootin' it.| Look, just help me catch this guy.
  Check, please.| How much longer till you finish editing, BMO?
  About twenty hours.| Twenty hours?!
  Yeah, you guys shot a lot of footage. About twenty hours.| Jake, let's talk about our movie.
  Okay.| I think we shot a lot of great stuff.
  Uh-huh.| But I'm thinkin' only half of it is usable.
  Me, too.| Really?
  Yeah, I was just thinking that.| That's great!
  I know.| You actually agree it's an action adventure!
  Yep, it—wait! No!| What?
  Romantic comedy!| What?!
"  What do you mean ""what""?!"| Who's right, BMO?
"  Why wait?  ""Dear BMO, Please use only the best footage when cutting the movie. Love, Jake."""|" ""And Finn."""
  See you at the movie club, then.| Oh, I'll be there.
  As will I.| As will I, as well.
  Heh heh. Alright, thanks again everyone for coming to...  movie night! I hope y'all are in the mood to laugh.|I hope y'all are ready to be on the edge of your seats for tonight's action adventure film.
  Eeee...| Well, I guess we'll see!
   Oh, my gosh!| BMO's right. Fighting over this movie junk is dumb. I'm sorry, man.
  I have to go check on something!| Can we go with?
  Stay close to me. | Whoa!
  At the heart of this tree is an ancient evil, held in a prison of amber—the Lich.| What's that sound?
  He's casting spells—trying to get in your head and control your bod... but these gems are protecting our minds from his influence. If we lost the gems, we'd be defenseless.  He would have full control over us.| That's freakin' nuts!
  Finn, you have but one chance. While the Lich isn't at full power, you must smite him with this gauntlet!  His only desire... is to destroy life.   If you fail... he'll kill everyone.| No. That will not happen.
  Oh, and there's something else that I want you to have. The Lich's lair is supposed to be cold. ...I just don't want you to get sick.  Take this sweater. I made it myself.  I'm not great at knitting, but please wear it. I care about you, Finn.| I love it.
  Quickly now, Finn! Track the Lich by his trail of death.| Here I go!
  This is our first fate-of-the-world deal!| Yeah, man! We gotta shut this fool down hardcore!
  Running this fast makes my stomach hurt!| Run through it, man!  We gotta get beyond Iceberg Lake before the Lich!
 Other| What the heck, Ice King?!
 Other|  Why are you following us?! 
 Other| No!
 Other|  Ice King, go away, man.
 Other| No thanks, guy. Hmm? How does this gauntlet  work?!
  Whoa!| I can't turn it off!
  Punch it in the eye!| Phew!
  There! Out over the lake!| After his butt!
   I'm your dingy dog!| Here! I'll help paddle!  Hey. It's me.  Aw, come on. I'm sorry I punched you in the ball.
  Waaaah!| Ah, yeah, haha! Closing in... Gonna get you, man!  Closer, Jake!  Closer... closer...
 Other| PRINCESS?! NO!
 Other|  ICE KING!!
  Guys! Don't let the Lich reach his well of power!   Oh, no!! He's made it!!| Don't worry, Princess!
 Other| I don't have time for this!
  Then let's go!| My pack!!
   He's gettin' his powers back! Weird!| No!  Prepare thyself... to get smote in the name of Bubblegum!!
  Finn...| Oh, no.
  Finn...  Come...|  STOP!!! 
  Aren't you cold... Finn...?  Walk into the well... Finn... Aren't you cold...?| NO, I'M NOT!! I'VE GOT A SWEATER ON!!
  You are a joke to me!! |  This sweater... It's keeping me safe!
  I care about you, Finn...| This is it. The ultimate weapon against evil—the power of... l-l-l-l...llliking someone a lot.  LICH!!!
  Finn!! Buddy!!|  Jake?  Jake!
  Wait, Finn!|  What!?
 Other| NO! Just shut your mouth, old man!
 Other|  JUST GET OUT OF HERE!!
 Other| Sorry about that, Peebles.
   Finn! Finn! The other princesses and I made you a new backpack!| Whoa, Raggedy Princess! It's so awesome! Thank you.
   You look like sick, grey meat, but we're gonna jack you up so awesome.| We should wheel 'er to her bedroom, right?
  Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks.| Like fake magic?
  Princess... Princess...  Surprise!| We picked every flower in the Candy Kingdom just for you! 
  Whoo-oo!| Princess Bubblegum?
  Oh, jeez!!  What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?!|  Quiet, dude. We're supposed to take care of her, not make her feel bad!
  I know, man, but she just seems... weird.| She's just messed up from the accident, man. We just have to take care of her 'til she feels better.
  Uh... Okay, dude.| Princess! Princess, no! You shouldn't be out of bed!  Princess... I... I gotta tell ya somethin'. Uh... Jake... 
  Oh. Gotcha. I'll go get some tea! | Princess... this sweater you made me kept me safe. I almost got super messed up, but... it saved me. And I wanted to say... thank you for imbuing this sweater with the power of liking someone a lot. Because... I like you a lot.   Haha, uh... We shouldn't talk about this now. You should rest.
   Finn... I need you to get me some things...| Yes, Princess.
  Whoa...  Uh... somethin' weird's goin' on...|  Jake!
   AH!| I'm gonna get some stuff for PB. Be right back.
  AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!  OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB!!  Maybe the toxic waste did somethin' to her brain—made her have demon powers—or somethin’!  Yo, dude! Wait! What's all that biz?!| Uh, bleach, lighter fluid, ammonia, gasoline, I dunno. Lady stuff. Plutonium...
   Thanks. | No probs!
  Wait! Hold on!| What's up?
  Listen... PB's bed was on fire.| What?! Is she okay?!
   She made it on fire.| With a match?
  No, man. With her brain... I think...  Look, man, I'll show you!| Jake, wh—
  Shh!!  P-P-P-Princess...?|  Over there!  PB? You in there?
   I'm busy!| See? It's fine. She's just havin' private time.
  I'm lookin' in! | JAKE, WHAT THE HEY?!
  Oh, my gloob!|  Come on, man, that's pervy!
  You don't even know, man.| DUDE?!
  Look!  See it!| Hold on, Peebles!  PRINCESS!  AAH! PUT DOWN THE TUB!
 Other|  Whaaah?... Ice King? What are you doing here?
 Other|  You don't know that.
 Other| Listen, you old poot. I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice. GET STUFFED. Come on, Jake.
  Listen, you old poot. I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice. GET STUFFED. Come on, Jake.| We're coming, Princess!
  Dude! I think we should let the Ice King help! He can freeze her, which could buy us some t—| Dump that mess! I'mma set 'er free with my like-like sweater!
  Woooh, do it! | I like you, Princess!!
  Finn!!| Urrgh...  Liking her... didn't work. She's unstoppable... unless...   Ice King, I... I need you to freeze Princess Bubblegum. Will you help me?
 Other|  Yes.
 Other| I'll distract 'er up top, you freeze 'er legs!
 Other| I'M A CAT! I'M AN AGILE CAT! JAKE! DUCK!  MEOW, ICE KING!  Thanks, bird!
 Other| You did good, Ice King.
 Other| Yeah, man.
   Duuuude...| We gotta get 'er to the hospital!
   ...I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake.| I hope she's okay...
  Attention, everyone...|  IS PB OKAY?!?
  Yes... but there were some complications.| NOOOOOOO!!!!
 Other| 13 years old? That's how old I am.  Uh...
  Man, I still can't believe Marceline is 1,000 years old and has never seen Heat Signature. This movie is gonna blow their minds.| Marceline! We brought Heat Signature.
  Hey, so I want you all to meet Finn and Jake. They aren't... completely lame.| Whatup?
  We used to be in a gang together back in the underworld.| Hmm. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Hope y'all like getting your minds blown, cause it's showtime.
  Hmm. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Hope y'all like getting your minds blown, cause it's showtime.|  What is wrong with this couch?
  Oh yeah. Sorry, I don't ever really sit on there. I just float usually. We... kinda all do.| Aww, what? man, no fair.
  Yeah, well, too bad you're not vampires. So, anyways, I...| Wait! Hold on just a second.
  Wait! Hold on just a second.| Marceline, we insist you turn us into vampires. Or ghosts, or whatever. We just wanna fly.
   Don't worry, I've got something more fun in mind. | Okay, Marceline, we're ready now.
  Boop boop. Boop. Boop. Okey dokey. All done. How do you guys feel?| Pretty... much... the same.
  Don't you feel a little hungry...for blood?|  I felt it. Jake, do you feel it?
  Yeah, I could go for some blood.|  Oh no. Jake. Now we're gonna have to drink blood for all eternity.
  Relax, guys. You can satisfy your bloodlust without killing. Look.  You just eat the color. Here, Jake. You try. | Ugh. Come on.
  Sorry, bro.  Oh, snap! I feel... stronger. | Whooooa... Marceline, can we float now?
  Okay, guys, the first phase of vampire orientation is learning...  ...invisibility. | 
  You ready for the power of...invisibility?| With all my heart.
  We're invisible! | You're invisible! 
  Wow! LSP's a hobo!| Let's mess with her.
  Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff!|  She knows it's us.
  She must recognize our voices.| Let's disguise them.  We're invisible!
  Weeeee!| Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, Jake!
  You guys ruined everything! I'm gonna kill you!| But we're undead. 
  Nice vampire scare, guys.| Thanks.
  Yeah, pretty good, fellas.  You guys ready...for the next vampire lesson? | You know we are.
  Good. | Ow! What's the point of this lesson?
  Kick 'em harder! | Ow! It hurts!
  Finn, Jake. You guys okay?| We're okay.  It's all worth it.
  Hey, guys, I think you're ready to learn how to float. All you have to do is jump off that ledge. | Cool.
   W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating. Like... uh... the spooky vampire walk. See? Spoooooky... wooo!| Heh heh. No way.
  We'll suck their guts out through their brains!| Did you see us?
  Hey, we're gonna throw a party... in honor of your new vampire skills.| Holy snaps, that's awesome!
  Guys, promise me you're going to that party.| We're not gonna go.
  You're not?| Nah. I'm kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill.
  Oh. Okay.| Well, we're going back home.
  Peace.| Number 25, Blood Drive.  Hey guys, we're here! Wow! Look at you guys! That's awesome!
  Number 25, Blood Drive.  Hey guys, we're here! Wow! Look at you guys! That's awesome!| Uh...  Georgy, what's wrong? Jake, what's happening?
  I think they're testing our vampire abilities.| Oh, sweet. VAMPIRE KICK! 
  You know you're not even real vampires.| Pssh. Then why am I flying, Wendy?  Oh.  Yo, man. I think Marceline tricked us.
  VAMPIRE KICK!!!  Finn. Jake. I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should've never pranked you so perfectly.| It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us.
  Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing. I just came to apologize.| Aw, man.  I can't believe we're gonna die just because we wanted to be comfortable watching Heat Signature. 
  I... I... I can't seem to locate... our heat signature.|  This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop. Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever?
  MMM-HMM. After the movie.| Well, can't we just--
  Yeeeaaah!| What's for B-fast, Jake?
  Everything burrito!   I love you, everything burrito.  Oh, man. I think someone wants to eat everything burrito! I won't let 'em get ya, baby! | Jake! Come on! Get ready!
  So cute!| Look at their little faces! Haha!
  We're not cute! We're evil, ...and we're here to dominate you!| Get the camera, Jake!
  Enough! Now... bow down to me, Cute King, and my legion of Cuties!| Great shot, BMO!
  My burrito!| It's perfectly fine.
  No, Finn... They probably poisoned it!| Naaaaawww...
  They knew my name. They knew about the burrito.| Man, you're letting your brain dial turn your fear volume up. You'll see. Those Cuties are nothing but an afternoon's delight.
  Man, you're letting your brain dial turn your fear volume up. You'll see. Those Cuties are nothing but an afternoon's delight.| Jake? What're you doing in my bed?
   Oh, nothing much. You know, just... chillin'.| Wait a second... Are you still messed up about those little guys?
   A little.| Look, man, whaddaya say tomorrow morning we go track those little guys down and find out just what their deal is? Sound good, buddy?
  Yeah. Thanks, buddy.  Man, you sound just like Mom sometimes.| Yeah. Good ol' Mom.
  She always knew just what to say.| Yeah. Goodnight, brudda.
  Goodnight.  Finn! Finn!  Finn, wake up, man!| Wha? Huh?
  I think someone's in the house.  For real, man! Shh, listen.| Uh...
  I swear, man! I really heard something.  Finn!!| I heard.  Okay. Who's out there?
  What the—?! That's my sword!  What do they want with my sword, man?!   It came from downstairs.| Alright. That's it.
  Where are you going?| I'm gonna go man-handle those guys's banandles! 
   ...What?! | Well, they broke a window, but I don't see any of 'em.  I guess they left. 
  Oh, no. OH, AWWW, NO!| Jake, what is it?!
  Jaaaake! Fiiiinn! This is the voice of your moooom! I've come back to tell you how dumb you always aaaare!  I hate you guys so muuuuch!| Get 'im, Jake!
  Aaah! Aaah!| Jake, I got 'im! He's freakin' out, man! What do I do?!
  Shake 'im!| What?!
  Shake 'im around 'til he stops!| Okay.  Rrrrrrr!  They stopped.
  Okay. Now tell 'im not to talk about our mom!| How do you even know our mom?
  Learning your weaknesses.| What?! Why?!
  Hold 'im!| Oh, gross. 
  Well?! Do you believe me now, Finn?!| I... I don't know what to believe anymore.
  There's gotta be a thousand of 'em!| Wait. Jake, look.
   These guys aren't a threat to anyone.| These guys are a threat to themselves.
  These guys are a threat to themselves.| Oh, hey, it's what's-his-face!
  Wanna just smash 'em all?| What?! No, man, look. These guys aren't gonna quit until they win or die, ...and they're not gonna win, so what if we let 'em win, just this once?
  What?! And mess up my stats?!| No. We'd be winning by helping them to win. That's a win!  And then they'll be happy and leave us alone.
   Alright.| Yessss! Now, let's rally an army so we can look intimidating.
  Who're we gonna call?| All of our friends.
  All of our friends.| My army of friends! Today, we will lose this battle, but we will also win it!  When the enemy charges, crumble like a cookie. When you feel their puny punches, fade like a flower, and writhe in your own blood!
  But, but... how are we to bleed if none of this is real?| With faith, m'lady... and ketchup!
  Ketchup is delicious and deceiving!| And hey, guys... Let's keep the acting subtle. Less is more.
"  No way. First, I'm gonna fall in love with one of those little guys, and then I'm gonna fall out of love, and then, I'm gonna totally fake-die of a fake heart attack!  ""OH! MY HEART! MY HEART HURTS BECAUSE I FELL OUT OF LOVE! AND NOW I HAVE TO DIE! OOOOHHHHH!!!"""| Get ready, y'all. Together, we fall!
  Whoa.| Oh, no!  My blooood! 
   Tastes better than blood. Or does it? Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup?| Jake. Look. 
  Aw, nuts.| Cute King, wait up.
   We wanna apologize for being fakers.| We did it to protect you from yourselves.
  It doesn't matter now. No one will ever fear our strength.| But strength isn't your strength. Adorable cuteness is!
  Can I use it to control others?| Um... yeah, sure! Just be righteous about it.
  Psshh. Hey, you wanna bump baby lumps?| Sick. No. Just try to follow the plans, okay?
  Yeah.| Come on out, cuties. It's safe now.
  Now get out of here. | Hey, you hear something? Up there.  It's a fat, fat warrior beat. It's all...   It calls me forth. 
  Fighters! Fighters!  Seek you glory from the Fight King?| Mmmm... Maybe.
  Then step forth beyond the Moonlight seal to bathe in blood and glory forever.| Nah. This is a trap.
  Ka-psshh.   We snuffed out that trap like champs! Trying to get us up in that cursed arena.| Then I'd bet the exits would all magically seal behind us.
  We'd probably have to fight Gladiator Ghosts.| Yeah. That sounds... so dumb... and FLIPPING AWESOME!
  Fools! All exits are sealed!  Now you must fight my Gladiator Ghosts!| Yeah. Okay.
  Yeah. Okay.|  I'mma beat you with your own thing. Give it up!  Hah-hah!  Ooomph!
  I'll kill you for breaking your promise!| Yeah. Ah-ha-ha-ha.
  Good... Take these branches of palm.| Yeah.
  That prize kinda stinks. Let's go, Finn. My thighs hurt.  | Aw, man. Okay, it was fun. I'm keeping the branch. 
  Where do you think you're going?  You must earn thy freedom by defeating each of my ghosts! When you are ready, speak the Fight King's name, and I shall raise you for... battle.| Hmm. Okay, I have a plan. We'll do what the Fight King says, and defeat his ghosts to earn our freedom.  You're gonna follow my plan, right?
  Mmm-hmm. But, hey, if you replace me with a dummy, I could stay down here and dig for lava. Then I'd forge a molten hula-hoop.| That's an entirely different plan... than my plan. What's the hula-hoop for?
  Check it out, dude.  Ba-duh-buh-da. It's a dirt dummy Jake. Just like in the plan.|  We're ready... I guess, Fight King.
  Gladitoria continues for you, human, and, er... dog?| Yup. This is dog.
  Et tu, Verus?| Heh.
  Come closer, my champion. You have proven worthy of my favor.| Hah. Word.
  Yeah. I lives. Finn, come with me, man.  Whoa! Dude?| Sorry, man. But you crossed my kill zone.
  So, how's your side of the plan going?| Plan? What plan?
  To escape. I dig and stuff, and you fight to win, 'member?| Yeah. I fight. To hear bones breaking and meat tearing.
  Ghosts don't got meat.| I fight... to FIGHT! 
   Hmm... Finn's acting weird. Probably due to a decrease in morale. Gotta get him that lava hula-hoop.| We're ready for our next fight, Fight King.
  Gotta liven up this unhallowed ground.... for Finn.  ♪ On a tropical island, underneath a molten lava moon. Hanging with the hula dancers, asking questions 'cause they got all the answers... ♪| Habet! Habet! Habet! Heh-heh-heh. 
  Amazonia, I'm sorry! | This next take-down is for you, my king! Rahhh...  Heh-heh-heh.
  Non pugnent, Flamma! | Eludere!
  Cum missione, my friend! | Hoc habet! Whaaa! 
  Achillea...| I have defeated every gladiator.
  No, for there is one more opponent.| Who?
  Your dear companion! |  
  Why do you stop?| Fight King, this Jake was a farce. Let me face the real Jake!
  Then this is round two, my vassal! Take his head for me!| Yes, my king. 
  What about the plan?| This is the plan, Jake! Raah! 
  You're gonna kill me?|  That's right! Everything has been building to this! The final battle! Brother against brother! TO THE DEATH!
  Yes...|  Fight King!!! I can't do it.  I can't kill him, Fight King. I can't kill my best friend.
  Finn?| Not without a BIGGER SWORD!
  Aaarghh... | Wink. 
  What?  Dude, did you...? Was that all fake? Did you act all that out? Was that part of your plan?| Mmm-hmm. 
  So you planned to get all cozy with the Fight King and almost kill me from the get-go?| Pretty much.
  Why didn't you say so?| Because you always bungle my plans. But, if you had bungled this one...  I might have, for real, chopped your head off.
  That's some funky junk, brother.| Hey, Jake, you notice how all these ghosts are walking in pairs?
  Oh, yeah. I bet they're like us. Best bros who got trapped in that arena.| But now they're free!
  What?! Then why am I running so hard?| Because...
  Marceline!| Faster, Jake!
  Oh.| Marceline! What's wrong with her?
  She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber.| Tell us how to break the spell.
  Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms. Just legs.  Yeah, there we go... oh. | What? What'd you do to my forehead?
  When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here, take this.  It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head.| Like this? 
  Whoa. Whoa!| So... if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline?
  Who are you guys?| We're Finn and Jake.
  What are you guys still doing here?| We're trying to wake you up.
  Ooo! Ooo! Could be jams and pickles down there!   Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it! Ooo, ice cream| I want some! Huh? 
   Come on, Finn!| Yo, man.
   Daddy, why?| It's our treehouse. This must be when Marceline lived here.
  Who's this guy supposed to be?| Ash, I guess.
  |  This place reeks.
  Yo, man, your thing is glowing.| My what?  Oh, my thing.
  We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on.| Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again.
 This way, Finn! Check out this whacked out memory crack! It's ba-nay-nay down here!| The core!
  All these orbs must be her memories.| How are we supposed to know which one to grab?
  Play hot-cold with your forehead!| Alright.  Hot or cold?
  The important thing is... Marceline's awake. | Marcie, Marcie! You're okay.
  Quit touching my hair!| You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend.
  Oh, Ash.| What?
  Oh, no!| What?
  Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar, let's go.| No, Marceline!
  Ashicus Flyicus. | They're gone, man. He took her!
  I could smell them in there. So what's the plan?| Um. Okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed until Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline.
  Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here! Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals.| Yeah, okay. Sorry Marceline, I'll go. I just gotta show you something first.
  Hello? Finn?| Hey, there you are. 
  Finn, what's going on? What is this place?| It's my old house. That magic powder--it put you in my memories. Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of you breaking up with him. But it's okay because I saw the memory. Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See? 
  Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now.| You gonna be okay, Marceline?
  Huh?  Sis, give me the phone.   Oh, hey, Finn. I got another Ice King situation here. Oh, yeah? That would be great! Thanks.| Ice King?! How many times have we warned you about using love potion?
  Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways.|  Yeah, you stink so much I'm gonna ground you for a week!
 Other| You're grounded for two weeks!
 Other|  Three weeks.
 Other| Four weeks?
 Other| That just grounded you for four weeks.
  Oh, nah, I'm just trying to show you how many weeks ya got.| Get outta here, bubble-butt!
  Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right? | Mine's whack. 
  Well, put some meat in there!| Huh. What kind of meat is that?
  That's Meat Man's meat.| Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat?
 Other|" What do you think ""grounded"" means?!"
  It's wasted, man.| Oh, great. Now see what you did to my buddy? So help me, Ice King.
 Other| It's alright, buddy. We can make another. 
 Other|  Punch, punch, punch!
  Hey, Finn, you awake yet?|  I'm trying.
  I had a dream about Meat Man.| Oh, yeah?
  I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man. | You're grounded!
  Good job. Good job, the Ice King.| Oh, my life!
  C'mon, man, let's get outta here!| Jake, do something. He's getting close!
  Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long.| What do we do?
  No way, man!  You already messed up enough stuff. You're probably gonna kill us, too.| Yeah, we don't trust you!
  Finn? Finn? Finn! Where are you? I need you to try this!| I'll be there in a sec! 
  What's the status?| Good, man!
  Nice! Seal the deal, bro!|  Okay, man! Whatevs!
  Where's the key to the tower, BMO?! Tell me! AAAGH!| Okay, Finn. She's 13; you're 13. Just have fun! Be yourself.  Wooooo!
  Okay, Finn. She's 13; you're 13. Just have fun! Be yourself.  Wooooo!| What's that? Are you trying to make yourself 18 again?
  Nah. This is an instant bath serum. It makes you sweat cleaning agents.| I don't bathe. I want that!
  I don't bathe. I want that!| WAAAUGH! Hot, hot, oh—WAAAAUGH! Oh... so spice! So spice!
   TOO YOUNG! TOO YOUNG TO RULE THE KINGDOM!| Watch your manners with the princess--!
   HHHHUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOH?!| What the huh?
  MMMM!  HAH!  I am next in line to thee throne! Sooo... I will be in charge... UNTIL PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM turns... 18 again!| That's bunk! Right, Preebos?
  No... He is rightful ruler under kingdom law. It's complicated.  I created Lemongrab.| 
   NNNNOOOOOOOO!!!| We'll see you in a few hours... okay, Starchie?
  Finn, this is dirt balls! We gotta do something to make him leave!| Yeah... like pranking him up his face!
   I don't think that worked out too math, Finn.| What? No, no! He just needs some more prankin's to finish the job! He'll leave the kingdom. Let's try it my way this time, okay?
   Cough, cough!  Oooooh...  Ha, ha-ha... GOOD ONE!  Keep 'em coming! I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!!! Ho... ha... Ah-ah-oooow!| I got a new plan!
  Oh, yeah? What?|" We'll work together and use that serum you made. The one that was ""Ah! So Spice!"" And spice-bomb him non-stop 'till his butt falls out! How's that sound?"
  | Hoooo! 
 AHHHHtatatataNO!! That's why I am royal and you are servile!| You ready to pour the stuff?
  Yeah! I made it super-hot this time!| Wait 'till he opens the lid!
  HHHHAAAAAAA!!! HAAAAAAA! HAAAAAAA!!!! AAAAAAAGHAAA!!!!!| Shh!
  Mmmm!| Heh, heh... heh! 
  OOOOOONE MILLION YEEEEEEEARS, DUNGEON!!!!| Maybe if we... set his butt on fire.
  No, Finn... There's only one way. I just didn't want to have to do it. If I change myself back to my real age, I can reclaim the throne.| What? No! I mean... you can do that?
  | Then... why did you wait so long?
  Because being 13 again is... Bloobaloobie!| Hm?
  While being 18 is all plock dumps and wagglezags... I never really get to act like a kid. But, it's okay. Really. My people need me, and that comes first!| Yeaaah...
  Oh, thank you! Thank you, all! Okay... Next we need a bonding agent.| Princess? I think I can help.
  Princess? I think I can help.| Finished!
  There's one last thing we need.  Only the heat from a whopping love hug can catalyze the re-age-ifying process.|  Are you ready, Princess?
  Yes, Finn. But... first, I just want to say how much fun I've had hanging out with you.| Me, too!
  And I... I wish I could stay... like this, with you, but--| I... I know, Princess.
  I'm so glad everything's back to normal. Thanks for all your help, Finn.| Oh- you're welcome! But... uhm...
  What is it, Finn?| Well, ah... Do you... do you wanna hug some more?
  What? Finn, you silly! That was, like, five years ago! You really gotta move on.| Oh- yeah, yeah... Sorry...
  Such a silly boy.| Hello?
  Hey, man! What's the status?| Bad news, man... I... I got dumped.
  Yesss!  Does that make sense?| Yeah, man. I see what you're sayin'. Thanks, Jake.
  Mmm-hmm.|  Go up the wizard steps.
  She's been missing for days!|Whoa, stop your crying, you two. We'll help you find your daughter. We'll find her using Jake's muscles.  Dude, show off your muscles!
 Whoa, stop your crying, you two. We'll help you find your daughter. We'll find her using Jake's muscles.  Dude, show off your muscles!|Whoo!
  No more tears, Boobly-Bear.  Please, take her these sandwiches we made. She loves these sandwiches. Thank you, boys.|Whoo!
 Whoo!|Dude, I know where Lumpy Space Princess is. She's in the woods eating beans.
 Mmhmm! This is gonna be easy as... uh... mm...|Easy as childbirth!
 Please, please help me. A monster is terrorizing our village and has eaten up all the crops.|Why were you up here in this tree?
 I thought I saw some food, and I was hiding from the monster.  You must help. |Hmm. I guess we can help this guy real quick and then get back to LSP.
 Food! Food! |Wait! You can't eat this food! It's not ours to give!
 Aw.|Now, show us the way to your town.
 Too tired from hunger. Carry me?| Okay. 
 Be alert. Anything could pop out of there and rip our faces off. |Whoo. 
  |It's you!
 LSP, what the heck are you doin' here?|Are you in here making out with the monster?
" I was rescued by a family of wolves. The mama wolf was all like, ""We must take care of her, as if she were our own."" And Papa Wolf was all like, ""This is a special child who needs special love because she's gonna be great when she grows up."""|So these were talking wolves?
 Anyway, then I found this windmill, and whenever I get hungry, I dress up like the monster and I go eat all the villagers' crops.|LSP, you're stealing!
 Thanks, Finn.|LSP, if you wanna feel better, you should apologize to the farmers and make amends.
 Don't get all bent out of shape! I'm just being honest!|LSP!
 What?|That apology was terrible!
 We have to!|Well, you don't have to.
 You guys are parents? Just like my parents...  |LSP, are you okay?
 Yeah, they're really good. They're made with a lot of love.|It's working!
 And thank you, Finn and Jake.|No problem.
 I'm staring because I can't move my head.|
 No, really, I can't move.|I can't move either.
 What's happening?!|What? What was that? Who goes there?
 Hey! Who is that?|Jake, use your peripheral vision!
 Other|What did you do to us, Ice King?
 Other| Freezing Potion A.
 Other| Unfreezing Potion A?
 Just unfreeze us now, man.|Yeah, 'cause we're already friends.
 Other|Uh, yellow? Orange? Blue—no, no, lavender! Lavender! Yeah!
 Other|How did you—?
  Wenk!|You lock your bottles?
 Don't touch my lemons, Ice King! Ice King!| Jake, look!
  Gunter! No, Gunter! No!|No, Gunter, no!
 Wenk! |No, Gunter! No!
 No! Gunter! No!|Gunter, stop!
 What're we gonna do?!| When someone loses one sense, their other senses are enhanced—like a blind man who can smell and hear really well. I'm gonna try using my now-enhanced brain sense to make contact with an Astral Beast who will help us.
 What?|Whee! Haha! Whee! Astral Beast, come to me!
 Whee! Haha! Whee! Astral Beast, come to me!| Come to me, Astral Beast...
 I can't take this any more! Dang it, Finn! What are you doing in there?|Astral Beast! Where are you? You come here NOW!  Wheee...!
 What?  He fell asleep with his eyes open. Finn! Finn, snap out of it!|Astral Beast! WHERE ARE YOU? Show yourself! Why not? Does this dance please you, Astral Beast?  Does this please you?!
 Astral Beast! WHERE ARE YOU? Show yourself! Why not? Does this dance please you, Astral Beast?  Does this please you?!|THIS IS IIIIT!
 THIS IS IIIIT!| The Astral Beast cometh.
 Dude, you're back!|Yup. I just got back from the Astral Plane!
 Where's your Astral Beast?|It's on its way. It's gonna be awesome.
 What kind of beast?|Uh, I'm not sure. I couldn't see it in the Astral Plane. But I heard it. It sounded really intense.  Maybe a gorilla?
 A gorilla, huh? |Aw, junk! Did I summon butterflies?!  I'm the worst.
 Hey, come on now, you're not the worst.|Yeah, I am.
 No, you're not! You're the best!|...at being the worst.
 |What are you doing?
 I'm using my enhanced brain sense to tell your astral beast to slap some sense into you.|Oh. That's cool. I deserve it.
 Other|What do we wa—? We want you to unfreeze us, you lunatic!
 Other|Friends don't eat each other, Ice King. That's not how friends work. Now unlock this bottle and unfreeze us.
  Jake.|  Wizard Battle is starting soon!
   I know! We got here six hours early, you dork! Just wake me up when they start selling hot dogs.  Whoa! What do you know! | The wizards are arriving!
  The wizards are arriving!| Whoo-hoo! Yeah!!!
   Ladies and gentlemen...| 
  I am the Grand Master Wizard of Ceremonies. And now, the rules. Contestants will fight each other with spells from the eight schools of magic.  No science, Science Whyzard!  No weapons, Weapon Head!  To enter Wizard Battle, you must be a wizard!|  Whoo, wizard only allowed! Whoo. Whoo. Wh-... Oh, what? Ice King!
  Boo!| You're a contestant?!
 Other| Phshoo, you're gonna lose, man.
 Other|  Jake, we gotta enter the contest and stop Ice King.
  But we're not wizards, man. What about the sanctity and honor of Wizard Battle?| I'd rather sanctify PB's lips.
  Ooooh! You don't care about the Ice King. You just wanna kiss Princess Bubblegum.| No! I wanna save the princess!
  Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do.| I do!
  Yeah, you do.| Oh, shush! 
  Oh, shush! | Now, where's the Ice King.
 Other| We need a plan, man.
  Looks like everyone had the same plan.| What are they waiting for?
  The opposites.| Huh?
  The wizards with opposite powers will take each other on first.| And are you a wizard?
  Yes. My name is Abracadaniel. | Hi, Abracadaniel. My name is, uh, Magic...  Fist.
  Who's that?| He's my, uh, magic second head.
  Well, he's right.  I only entered this contest 'cause I thought the prize would be money. But it's just a kiss!| You mean, you don't care about kissing PB?
  Blegh, no way. If I was the winner, I would turn my face so our lips  wouldn't touch and I would push Princess away. Turn and push, turn and push, turn and push...| 
  ...turn and push, turn and push. Well, I'm going back to my cave to wait for someone to kill me. Goodbye.| Wait! Abracadanny, don't you worry about a thing. I'm gonna protect you.
  You will?| Yeah, man. Also, I have an idea for how you can help me save PB's lips.
 Other|  Cheating!
   Cheating!| He's using a weapon!
 Other| Now's my chance to stop him.
  Now's my chance to stop him.| Huwahh?!
  Huh?|  No!  Jake, two o' clock!
   No!  Jake, two o' clock!| Okay, now to stop the  Ice Kiiing...?
  My body is squishy. That's how I survived.| Whoa! That's turbo amazing!
  Whoa! That's turbo amazing!| Stay close to me, Abracadaniel.
 Other|  Quick, listen! Now's the time for you to help me. 
 Other|  Watch out, man.
 Other| You got this, Danny boy!
 Other| Good job, Danny. You're not a wimp anymore. You should feel pretty good.
  I do. I feel real good.| I'm gonna forfeit now. I only wanted to stop the Ice King.
   Uh-uh.| I forfeit! I forfeit, everyone!
  I forfeit! I forfeit, everyone!| Meow.
  Oh, w-w-well thank you, Grand Master Wizard. I guess through this trial I have become a great wizard. I, I came here with no self-esteem and no chances, a will-o-wisp of a boy, but I walk out this arena a man. A confident man! Who deserves a kiss from a princess!| NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
  It appears you have knocked out Abracadaniel using the most shameful of all magic, a power shriek.  But since you are the last wizard, you are the winner of Wizard Battle.  Go get ready for your kiss, champ.| 
   Wow, man.| What?
"  I've never heard you scream like that before. You were all like, ""Nooo! No one kisses her but me!"""| Yeah, okay! I want to kiss her, alright? You got me! The big secret is out! Okay, Jake. I like Princess Bubblegum! ARE YOU HAPPY, JAKE?!
  Yeah, okay! I want to kiss her, alright? You got me! The big secret is out! Okay, Jake. I like Princess Bubblegum! ARE YOU HAPPY, JAKE?!| Whoa, Jake. Don't cry, man. I'm not really mad at you.
  Whoa, Jake. Don't cry, man. I'm not really mad at you.| I'm just sick of having to hide my feelings all the driz. It's exhausting.
 Then stop hiding you feelings, man! Go out there, and smooch it up! | Heh heh. Yeah, alright, man.
  You ready in there?| Yeah, I'm coming!
  Yeah, I'm coming!| Ooh, whoa!
  Ooh, whoa!| Oh, dag.
  What's going on here?| Uh, Ice King was cheating his way through Wizard Battle using nun-chucks, so Jake and I faked being wizards to save you from having to kiss him and we uh,  I dishonored Wizard Battle.
  Oh, Finn, ...you did all that for me?  That's for being sweet.  And that's for cheating. Finn, you know better than to ruin the sanctity of Wizard Battle. Wizards only, silly. Okay, everyone! Go home! Start getting ready for next year!| Heh heh, oh, well.
  Good job. You got the kiss, man.| Thanks, man. My face hurts a little.
  Don't worry about that, 'cause you look totally cool right now.| Thanks, dude.  Here, you try 'em.
  Okay, am I cool now?| So fly.
 Other| Uh...
 Other| Uh, it's good! It's good! It's really good, dude! It was amazing!
 Hey, man, what you doing?!| Dude!
 Don't worry, bro. We won't tell anyone about the private time you spend with your wad of Princess Bubblegum's hair.| You guys knew?
 Hmmm! Hmmhmmhmmhmm!|Who are you?
 Hmmhmm!|Come on!
 Get back here, you thieving Door Lord! You butt!|Come on, Bubblegum!
 Yeah.|Don't worry. We'll get him.
 Don't worry. We'll get him.|" No!  What?  ""This door shall yield to no command save for a song from a genuine band."" What is this gripagrap?!"
  | Hmm? The door said it will open for a genuine band. Let's try and music this door open as a quintet.
  I know how to get through this door. We're gonna lay down a chill jam.| Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
  Stop staring at me! Ugh, you threw me off!|Come on, everybody! Don't stop now. The door was responding to our music! I wonder what it liked or what was missing.
  Yikes.| Maybe to be a genuine band we need to be nicer to each other and hang out as buds.  Let's take a noodle break. Come on, it will help!
  Maybe to be a genuine band we need to be nicer to each other and hang out as buds.  Let's take a noodle break. Come on, it will help!|No! Wait, don't go, too!
 I'm just gonna get stuff to cook that.| Cook?
 That was sweet what you said about being buds.|Mm-hmm. Thanks.
 For our next attempt, I wanna be the lead.|Yeah! Sounds cool, my bud.
 Hmph!|Jake, you're back!
 Now, Finn, vibrate your uvula by dampening and undampening your larynx.|Wha?
  Go like this, silly.| Oh.  Whaaaa...
 Oohh...| One more time?
 I never said you had to be perfect!|Alright, time out, guys.
 Alright, time out, guys.|Princess! Princess, wait!
  Whatever,  Ugh! I'm outta here, too! |Marceline?
  You've all forgotten 'bout the music! I quit the band!  I'm just pretending!|Jake! Everybody! We can beat the Door Lord! ...Together.
  Hmm? Hmmhmmhmm!|It's over, Door Lord.
 Hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmmhmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm hmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmm!|What's he trying to say?
  Oh, you.| Ah, yeesh.
   Dude, I wear it all the time... as pajamas.| Wait, if that's Bubblegum's shirt, what are you missing, Marceline?
  Wait, if that's Bubblegum's shirt, what are you missing, Marceline?|Wait a second, wait a second! You don't have a thing! You just wanted to hang out with us!
 No, I didn't!|No way, you're caught! I figured you out! 
  Finn, lunch is ready!| Ugh, what are you cooking?
 It's good! I learned it from Rainicorn.|I'm not eatin' that. It smells funny.
 Dude, this took me, like—|Let's go over to Tree Trunks's and get some apple pie! Apple pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Let's go! 
 Whoa!  Eh.| Tree Trunks!  
  Tree Trunks!  | Tree Trunks! Tree Trunks?
 You!  You took my apples! |Whoa, whoa!  Tree Trunks, it's us, Finn and Jake!
 Finn... and, and Jake?|It's okay, Tree Trunks. We're here to help you. Just tell us what happened.
 NOOOOOOOO!|Don't you worry, Tree Trunks. We'll find those thieves and bring them to justice.
 Let me show you the crime scene.  You see, boys|Hmm. Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks?
 No, Finn, they didn't touch my rocks, or my birds, or my flowers, or, or nothing.|Hm. Well, I don't see any footprints. What'cha got, Jake?
  No ghost doodies. Oh. Oh, wait.  Oh, no. No.|Hm. Tree Trunks, is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up?
 Oh, heheh, hey, Finn. Heheh.|Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess. Have you seen anything fishy going on?
 Ne'er-do-wells? They stole my apples.  I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty!| Awesome. Where do we find these guys?
 Oh, the Candy Tavern, man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses.|
 Don't worry, I stopped doing that a long time ago. I didn't know it was wrong.|
  Oh, my!|Uh, does Princess Bubblegum know about this place?
 Be cool, man. You're gonna queer the deal.|Oh, yeah. Try not to act suspicious, Tree Trunks.
 Where—?|Oh. 
 Where's my dang apples?|Oh,  Tree Trunks, you're so silly. But, but listen, you wouldn't happen to have seen any—I don't know—apples around, have you?
" ""Seen any apples?"" Y'all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions... almost like you're trying to solve somethin'."|What? Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.
 Hold on, we gotta go potty.|Dang. They almost got us, but I think we blend in pretty well now.
  This, this toilet paper's drying my mouth all up.|Uh, Tree Trunks, don't eat that.  Here.   You gotta watch her, man!
 What can I do for you?| You know where a guy might maybe score some apples? 
 You go back, and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples 'cause they're ours now!|Wha-what boss?
 Your boss! Dr. J?|We don't know any Dr. J.
 What just happened?|I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks' apples also stole Dr. J's apples, and they thought we were workin' for him!
 Finn? Finn.|Hm?
 This could be dangerous, a-and if you want to go back home, I understand, but I need to do this.|Yeah, Tree Trunks, me too.
 Hey, Finn.|Hm?
  What's that on your face, buddy?|Oh, that guy bopped me one. Must've had a ring on.
 Y'know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before. Yeah, right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes.|What?!
  Yeah, you see? That guy must work here or somethin'.| Hello?
  Who's the heck happening? What?|Uh, we're here about the apples?
 Oh, okay. Let's see your ring.|Um...
  My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples. A whole crate. |What the?
 What's wrong, guy?|These aren't apples.
 |Aw, don't cry, Tree Trunks.
 Yep.|You mean apples that we eat?
 Oh, so I was the apple thief after all.|No, Tree Trunks, that's preposterous.
 Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime. Goodbye.|Tree Trunks.
 This place could use a scarecrow.|Huh? Wait, what'd you say?
 Uh, I-I said this place could use a scarecrow.|A scarecrow, no footprints, all those magpies on the roof, Raggedy Princess in the ditch, and all the apples in Tree Trunks's closet.
 Boy, this place could use a scarecrow.|That's it!  I knew it!
 That's it!  I knew it!|The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole!
 And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree!|Yes. And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off!
 As innocent as a baby's butt cheek!|  Awesome! This calls for a celebration! You know what that means, Tree Trunks!
  This stinks! Hey, how much longer till we get to the mysterious party?| Let me check the spooky invite sent to us by our anonymous host.  Oh. We're here. The party's in that castle.
  Let me check the spooky invite sent to us by our anonymous host.  Oh. We're here. The party's in that castle.| It's for us!
  What's it say?|  Wear me.
  Wear me? | Hello?
  Yoo-hoo!  Hey guys!| Princess Bubblegum, is that you?
  Oh yeah! Uh... It's Guy Farting.| Prince Hotbod, at your service. 
  I'm Randy Butternubs. | So... who's our host, anyway?
   Where? Where?| Here. Let me. 
  What's it say, Prince Hotbod?|  Esteemed guests, I am your host. I am a ghost.
   Esteemed guests, I am your host. I am a ghost.| By the time you finish reading this, I will posses one of you and use your body to murder everyone in the house.
  We gotta get out of here! | CB, wait! It says anyone who will try to leave will die!
  Yeaaaaah, right.|" Whad'ya mean ""Yeaaaah, right""?"
   Classic move.| Dude.  I swear I'm not pranking you. Cinnamon Bun is dead.
  Dude.  I swear I'm not pranking you. Cinnamon Bun is dead.| The question is
  The question is| One of us is possessed by a murderer. And if we want to stay alive, we have to figure out who's hiding a ghost inside their mortal body.
  One of us is possessed by a murderer. And if we want to stay alive, we have to figure out who's hiding a ghost inside their mortal body.| BMO! 
  Ahh!| Use your ghost detecting equipment to screen everyone.
  Nothing...| Did you see that? 
  Ew.| Huh?
  Let's find some candles. If the lights go out again, we'll be able to catch the murderer!| Good idea! Jake and BMO, you check downstairs and we'll take this floor.
  AHHH!  Oh my crease! Oh my crease! Assemble! Reassemble! Come on you guys!| Where's BMO?
  The ghost got 'im!| Don't you mean you got 'im-  Ghost!
  Chill out, girl.  You find any candles upstairs?| No.
  Well, I dropped a lighter downstairs, but there's no way I'm going back for that.| Uh-huh.  Let me remind y'all that the invite says that the ghost will possess one of our bods.
  Someone at this table isn't who they appear to be!|"  That's right,  ""Jake."""
"   That's right,  ""Jake."""| So let me ask you a question only the real Jake could answer. Who is always next to me in my recurring elevator dreams?
   A half-orc shaman.|  Okay, you're Jake. So, who else was absent when BMO got nabbed?
  Oh yeah, right! I'm not the ghost! I was in the potty house.| A convenient alibi. But tell me this...
  IT'S NONE OF YOUR LUMPING BUSINESS!| Sounds suspicious.  I bet you're the ghost!
  She did it! She's possessed! Tie her up!| Oh she is, huh? Well, before we tie up LSP, answer me this...
   Brad, he kissed me on the mouth! And I was like 'bleh-bleh-bleh', and then I was like 'Uh, gross. Go away, Brad' and he was like 'obviously you're not ready for me' but what does that even mean you guys? W-What does it lumping mean? |  But answer me this, Princess...
   What do you want from me, Brad?! You said I was the hottest one, isn't that enough?!  Why'd you have to ...my mouth! |  What did I write to you on your Happy Birthday card two years ago? Word for word.
   Finn, there's no way I would remember that...|  I remember that. 
   What! Wait you guys!  Look!|  A real ghost?!
  DAAAAAG!|  This wasn't supposed to... ha-a-appen!
  Aha!  I knew you were pranking me back, you!| Yeah... it was all a set up. The doors, Cinnamon Bun's and BMO's. Oh strizz! BMO and Cinnamon Bun should be in the closet over there.  Guys! Guys, guys! C'mon you guuuu-.
   OH MY GLOB! I can't take this, you guys.  I'm calling my lumping parents right now!| LSP! What's happening!
  Oh my Glob! I'm not ready! Get away!  Oh, gross!| Where'd did she GO?!
  RUN, HOMIE, RUN!| Open it!
  It won't open! |  C'mon!
   Okay...| Jake!
   Ow, ow, ow! I got a splinter!| Jakey!
  Don't let go, man!| Oh no! Your fancy GLOVES!
  Oh no! Your fancy GLOVES!|  Jake... Princess!
   Jake... Princess!|  YEEAAARGH!
   Haha! Gotcha, dude! Two for two!| WHAT!?
  I figured out your plan months ago! So I flipped the script. Oh yeah!| So everyone's okay.  BMO, Cinnamon Bun...
  Yeah, see?!| Whoa, sick! You can phase people into your body?!
   I'm ready for you now, Brad. Isn't it so obvi? I'm so ready.|  But, PB. You melted!
  It was a wax dummy, dummy! Jake switched me out while Lady was distracting you.|  Wow, you got me again! I can't believe that! With the hair, and the house coming alive and stuff...
  The what?| The walls and chairs trying to eat me and stuff.
  Eh, nah. You must have been so scared you imagined that part.|  Uh, no I didn't...
  Haha, nice try, Finn. Let's get outta here.| That one's going in the vault.  Aaaaand... It's gone.
  Hurry, Lady!|  It's happening again.
  That's right, Finn.| Princess!
  I escaped, but I wasn't able to stop Cinnamon Bun from infecting the rest of the kingdom. The good news is I still have all my notes for making the antidote formula.| Oh, sweet!
  Let's board up the windows then we can get started.| Princess!!
  Don't worry, Finn. You have the notes to my formula. Just let Science do the work. Science... is... my... rat...! | No...!
  Aw, nah! I am not getting eaten by zombies tonight.  Get the lump outta here!!! Ahh! Ahh!| Princess!
  These notes make no sense. It's all gobbledy-gak.| Alright, we'll each make our own version of the formula. One of us is bound to get it right.
  Alright, we'll each make our own version of the formula. One of us is bound to get it right.| Hmm?
  Hey, Princess Bubblegum trained her rat to dance. Neat.|  Done.
  Done!| Bubblegum, I'm comin' for you...!
  Bubblegum, I'm comin' for you...!| Mine first.
  Sugar!| Cram!
  Let's get out of here!| Stairs! 
  Stairs! | Jake, try yours and Lady's next!
  Oh. My. Glob. Look at those luscious lips. I gotta go lick up the rest of that formula! Aaaaaaah!  My formula!  Formula!  Oh, my Glob. Yes, I'm gonna be hot! So freakin' hot!  Yeah!| LSP, look out!
  LSP!| Dang it, Jake. We only got one formula left. Try yours and Lady's.
  Let's hope this works.| Wh-... where now?!
  We can barricade ourselves in the lab!| Did anyone get bit?
  What's the matter? | Jake! Did it get 'cha?
  It's all good, Sweetie. I can stretch forever. Hehehehe... Hey, let's hurry up with that antidote, huh, pal?  Whooa...| Okay, let's see here...
   You should try one of them books. Over there by the lab rat.| Ha! Yeah, okay.  Yes! This book has a glossary of symbols.
   That's great, buddy.| Jake, I think this little guy has serious dance fever.
  Hurry, dude!| I am! Okay, Jake's probably going turn into a zombie, which is okay. I just have to figure out this formula.
  Jake!| Hang on, Lady! I'll have the antidote soon, but whatever you do, just don't let him out. He may look like the Jake that once loved you, but he's just a zombie!
"  아니야. 얘는 날 사랑해. (""No. He loves me."") "| Hey, Lady... 
  Hey, Lady... | The book!
  The book!|  Sorry, everybody. Sorry, LSP, PB, Jake, LR, peepee poopoo doodoo.  You know, it's funny; I don't even know your name.
   Sorry, everybody. Sorry, LSP, PB, Jake, LR, peepee poopoo doodoo.  You know, it's funny; I don't even know your name.|" Yeah? What is it, girl?  ""Sci... ence."" Your name is ""Science""? Could it be?"
  Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH! | Hmm...
  Hmm...| Here goes nothing.
  Finn!| Jake!
  You did it! I huh, uh... | Don't worry, Science. I've got a disgusting idea.  Oh, my glob!
  And so the Royal Day of Apologizing has come to an end.  And now I shall present the Royal Medal for Heroic Bravery. Finn the Human.| Yes.
  Hey, what kind of coffee do you want?|" Hazelnut! Hazelnut! What if your name was ""Zelnut""? And then I would be all like ""Hey, Zelnut."""
  That's terrible.| Hey, Zelnut.
  Nooooo! Stop!| You hear that?
  Finn, help Susan.| Of course I will.
  Excuse us for a moment, Strong.  Dude, you know you're my bro, but that girl is bad news.| What? Naw.
  She's crazy, man. She's a fish person!| We don't know that!
  Dude, she tried to eat Peppermint Butler! She'd probably be worse if she was so scared of everything.| Whatever, look, she needs my help... and I'm gonna help her whether you're coming with me or not.
  Oh, I'm coming with you if only to be disruptive and obnoxious!| Susan, what can we do?
  I need your hero heart and your magic.| My magic?
  Come on. We swim there.| No, you don't understand. I'm not a fish person. I'm human.
  Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no! No, Susan, no!|  That was awesome. See, Jake? We can trust Susan. She's on the trolley.
  Whew, we safe now. |  What?
  Dude, she's crazy.| She's not crazy! She's cool!
  Whatever, man. This is a crazy cruise, and Susan is our crazy captain... and I'm a crazy clam-shell! Woo-ep!  Oh, doing the clam!|  Quit acting like a clam, you ham.
  Behold!| Balzacs! 
  Uh-huh. Finn, let's get outta here.| Come on. She knows this place. Trust. We're ready when you are, Susan.
  She's flippin' crazy! Come on, Finn. Let's bail.| Chill out.
  Chill out.| Alright, Susan, what do we do next?
  Hmm... never made this far before. Just gotta get past Lub Glubs.| Yeah, what are Lub Glubs, exactly?
  They... umm, look, they like this. | Hmm.
  Yes. Lub Glubs crazy scary. Hyoomans scared so long. Even Susan. That why glad I meet you. You have brave heart. |  Thank... you...
  Oh, thank Glob.| Whoa... Ominous.
  Bad news, dude. There's only two of us and more than, um,  this many of them!| We gotta use the fire, like Susan said. Are you okay with that?
  Yes! I'm okay with that! I'll do whatever Susan says! | Susan! We need you! 
   Susan scared... but Susan brave, too.  SUUSSSAAANN!!!!! | Yeah, Susan!
  Yeah, Susan!| Susan!
  Finn, win aide to fair Susan! Jake brings the fire!|" Humans and ""Hyoomans"" got to stick together!"
"  Humans and ""Hyoomans"" got to stick together!"| Huh?
   Almost... there...  Oh, so I just toss it in here? Pretty straightforward. Okay, well, here I go.  one, two, three...   That reminds me of... my mother. | It's working, Susan!  Jake.
  Whoa. It is beautiful.| You were right, Susan. This place is great. Well, we'd better get home.
  Finn, you stay.| No, I can't. I'm not like you.
  No, I can't. I'm not like you.| Susan...
  Be careful!|Grab him, Jake!
 Grab him, Jake!|Jake! W-whoa!
 Jake! W-whoa!|Whatever. 
 Whatever. |Oh, what happened? Where's the deer? Paging Dr. Ice cream! Dr. Ice cream cream for my mouth!  Ahh, dude, I broke my stems! Hello? Jake? Princess? What the blizz. Come on, people.
 Huh? Oh, Finn, you're awake!|Yeah, I'm awake, but my jams are all busted.
 Right. Yeah, I saw that.|So, what happened? Did you save everybody?
 Oh, yeah, I think so. Maybe.|So, Jake, there's nobody here. Did you notice that?
 Yeah, pretty freaky.  Don't worry—ouch—  they're all hiding.|From what?
 From me!|What?!
 It's my birthday, man! Lady Rainicorn put together a elaborate surprise party.|She told you?
 No, but I know Lady Rainicorn. Ouch!  This is totally something she would do. Think about it.|Oh, yeah, okay. So, wait, the whole kingdom is in on it?
 Yes, and they'll only come out if they think we'll be surprised. So we got to act like we're totally unaware, okay?|Okay, man, and how do we do that?
 Just do what I'm doing.  Oh, look at me, living free without a suspicion in the world. Never in my wildest dreams would I guess someone was plannin' a surprise birthday party for me!  Pretty tricky, right?  Come on, let's go back to the hut.|The what?
 Come on, come on! |Whoa. When did you find time to build this?
 I don't know. It didn't take long. |Hm. So, what should I do now?
 Collect branches for the hobo fire, dude.|Okay. 
  Ouchies.|A hobo fi-ya, fi-ya, fi-ya.  Boy, it sure is quiet around here! Uh-huh! I'd probably pee all over myself if somebody jumped out and surprised me!  Oh, ugh! I stink! How long was I out for? A day or two?  Huh. What a convenient place to bathe.  Sure seems like a good time to come out if y'all are just hiding and you don't, you know, wanna see me  pop my top!  Ahh, yeah, that's fresh. I nobody's gonna jump out of the bushes and peeps my bod!   Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! Hmmm.
 Just gotta char off the rotten parts—good as new, man! Stay vigilant. Eat your protein.|Jake?
 Hmm?|I'm starting to question your theory about the surprise party.
  Shhh!  Don't talk so loud! They might hear you!| But what if they're in trouble?  What if something happened to them? We should try looking around.
 Noooo!  You'll ruin my surprise party! Oww!   |Dude, are you okay?
 Just promise me, Finn. Promise not to look around.| Okay, I promise.
  ...my birthday's gonna be rad.|Hey, it's you!  Thanks for breaking my legs, ya dumb-butt!
 Hey, it's you!  Thanks for breaking my legs, ya dumb-butt!|That sounds like Candy People!
 That sounds like Candy People!|Jake. Jake!
  What?|I heard a sound coming from the sewer! We should check it out.
 No, man, they'll surprise party me when they're ready. Be patient.| I'm being patient! I waited all day, Jake!
 Well, I've been waiting six months!|Wait, what are you saying?
   Everything's gonna be fine, even if we have to wait forever.|Have I been asleep for six months?!
 Yeah, but don't worry about it, man.| Face it, Finn, your best friend is gone. 
 Hmm? Finn?| 
  Rah! Ah! Ah!   Noooo! |Oh, my Glob!
 Oh, my Glob!|
" Surprise!  ""Happy birthday, Jake!"" Ow! "| Hey, Jake! What are you doin'?
 This is how my party's gonna go down. Shake it, my friends.  Hey! Hey! Sure is great seeing y'all here. Really makes me think. Ow.   Lady, did you get extra TP for all the potty people?  No.  Well, we might have some party poopers here, and I want to be sure they don't wipe their buns on my cake.|Can I join your puppet party? We'll have twice the puppet voices!
 You won't run away?|Naw, man, I'm with you. Happy birthday, Jake. Really.
 Finn! Glad I can untie you, buddy.  Check it out! Finn finally made it to my party!|And I have a surprise for you! Close your eyes and don't open 'em until I tell you.  
 Finn? You lied to me?|Yeee-ow! 
  What about my party? Don't go! Finn!|Whup! 
 Whup! |Hello?
 Hello?|
 Surprise! Surprise! Suprise!|You... you did this?
 I did this? Ow.  They've been waiting for me, Finn, for my b-day!|Stop being crazy!
 Oof. Yoo-a-hee! I'm a woman! I'm a woman!|Mah! 
 Wha... what happened?|A deer skronked your head and you lost your mind, man! You imprisoned the Candy People for your own sick birthday fantasy. Look. 
 Wha—?!|Then who did?
 |Grrrr! Jake, you free the Candy People. I'll take on the deer. Naw-hyah! 
   Finn!|Huh?  Donk! 
 We did it, dude!|How's your noggin?
 Not crazy anymore! How's your legs?|Hmm, still broken. 
 Thank you for saving my kingdom, boys. The deer wanted our sugar, but I didn't give him any, if you know what I mean. | Um... pyew! It's stanky in here!
 Yeah, like bad breath and eggs.|Let's go home so we can get baths.
  Yeah, well, you know.| Thanks for cook-a-looking for us.
  Oh, you're welcome, Finn, and thank you for answering my urgent summons.| Hey, yeah. How can we aid thee? 
  It's no big deal. Finish your pie.| It is a big deal, and I demand deets.
   I suspect that I've been targeted by the Guild of Assassins.| Whoa, how do you know?
  I found this note stabbed to my door... man. |  Princess, we vow to protect your juice. Right, Jake?
  Sometimes, I think there's a monster who lives in my stomach, and that's why I'm hungry all the time. | Uhh, Princess, let's continue this briefing outside. I can't look at his mouth when he gets like this.
   W-w-why would you say that?| Dude, are you trying to freak her out?
  I don't know. I'm just thinking out loud here.| Are you trying to freak me out?
  I'm gonna pick you up now and carry you... to the window!| Jake, what are you...
   Oooh! | Jake?
  Finn  help me!| What's wrong?
  Uhh... Finn, uh, sing mom's lullaby. I'm so tired, Finn, from the meat. Please, you have to lull me to sleep.| Uhhh...
  I know you carry mom's music box around in your backpack!| Dude, I'm not going to sing mom's lullaby in front of other people...
  Please, pleeeaaase...| Alright, real quick while the princess is distracted. .
    Finn there's an assassin in my nose and she poisoned me and is making me kill Wildberry Princess!| Dude, stop playing games! This is serious!
  Dude, stop playing games! This is serious!|" Cat... noise? Oh, cats go ""meow."" Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow."
  Shh!| Meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow!
  Shh! Shh! Shh! |  Jake! Jake! What are you doing?!
  I did it!| What the flop, Jake!
  Time's running out, Jake! Do you want the antidote, or not?| What is wrong with you!
   Hey, everybody, everything's cool...| Everything's not cool, Wildberry Princess is still in danger!
  I...I...I probably shouldn't!| Huh? Jake!
   I'm full of poison...| The assassin!
  The name's Me-mow.| If you let Jake die, so help me I will kill you too!
  Try it, oaf!| Give me the antidote!
  Give me the antidote!| Face me, cat!
  Face me, cat!| Ugh, ow!
  | Give it up, Me-mow! You're only making my face look cooler!
  You're at my mercy!| Ha, you think you're hurting me? With that tiny dagger?
  We'll see who's laughing when you're blind!| It's over! Give me the antidote!
  What, this antidote? | No! You... milk-lapper!  Jake, come lick this treebark!
  Forget it, kid. I gave Jake enough poison to kill a dog fifty times his size.| Oh, no... 
 A magic dog? Nooooooo!!!!!!!  | How you feeling, dude?
  Oh, dear....| Nice defense mechanism, Wild B!
  | Ice King, this the last time you steal our sandwiches!
 Other| Yeah, and if you were us, you'd kick your fat butt!
 Other| Yaah! 
 Other| Got you now!
  You ... the ... real good. Nice... home.| Jake, do you think that puddle needs our help?
  Nah, it's a Snow Golem, man. I think he's laughing.| I thought Snow Golems and Fire Wolves hated each other.
  Oh, yeah, big time.| But they learned to get along.
   Finn, oh my grosh, Finn! It was amazing!| Whaaaa?
  I had a croak dream, Finn! My croak dream!| Oh... my glob.
  | For real? With the Cosmic Owl and everything?
  Mhmm!| Whoa, a real croak dream?
  Yeah man!  There was a rocket ship , you weren't there , and there was a Banana Man  and I ran out of air and in outer space  and isn't that great Finn!| Yeah, well no I mean, I don't want you to die! And where was I? I'm your best friend!
  Aww, come on Finn  There's nothing to worry about! Think about it, I don't know any Banana Man Finn and rocket ships haven't been reinvented yet! I'll probably live another hundred years, easy.| Ummm... Yeah, yeah I guess. .
  Someones downstairs.| I'll take a look. 
  Who is it?| It's the Banana Man!
  | Shhh!
   What do we do?|  I don't know!
   Is he still out there?|  Uhh no, he left. 
  Phew, see I told you today wasn't the day! Hey, you wanna make an ice cream pizza?| Jake, your croak dream just gave us the upper hand, we can cheat now, now we can cheat fate.
  Jake, your croak dream just gave us the upper hand, we can cheat now, now we can cheat fate.| We'll track down that Banana Man and crunk up his schemes and save you!
  Finn,  when I die my individual earth conscious is gonna go all everywhere while glob tallies my deeds!| What?
  I'm gonna be all around you!  In your nose, in your dreams and socks, I'll be a part of you in your earth mind!  It's gonna be great!| Dude, STOP. SAYING. ALL THIS. CRAZY. NONSENSE. It's makin' me messed up. I'm 13. You're messin' me up.
  No one can change your croak dream, Finn, not even you.| We'll see about that, come on!  Wait, just let him walk a few more steps.
  Why?| 'Cause that idiot's about to walk right into the sun and burn up. And we'll be done with him.
  No man, he's walking into his house! .| Oh, what?! He built his house on the sun?! This guy's insane!
  Finn, did you eat your breakfast?| No, why?
  Because you forgot how the sun works. The sun is actually far away, it's not just sitting on the horizon. | Oh. Right on. Lets chase after him!
  You gotta eat your breakfast man, eat the protein. Helps your brain.| Yeah, yeah whatever you say, Mom. Lets go!  C'mon!  What's he doin' with that glass? 
  Huh? Hmmm.   Uh, Uh, Uh, Yeah! There we go!| Jake! Stop talkin' about your croak dream. It makes me uncomfortable. 
  Dude, just except it!| No dude!
  What are you doing man?  Ahh!!| Hand me some leaves and twigs and stuff.  Hmmm. 
  Wait, you're not gonna kill him, are you?!| Naw, man.  It's just a warning shot to scare him in to moving far away from here. 
   Hmmm?  Ha Ha! Look Out! Woo Hoo!  Ha ha! You Hoo!  Hoo! Yeah! Woo! Do it! Yeah! Oh yeah! Woo!  Yeah!  Move it!  Work it! Ha ha!| I'm gonna try to shoot this arrow again.
  Whoa! | Don't worry, Jake, were gonna get this guy.
  Dude, man. I appreciate why you're doing this, but you're not gonna stop me from transcend in to Glob world!| I'm gonna cry, man. If you say that one more time, I'm gonna... Let's go fetch that first arrow to reuse, 'cause we're out of arrows. 
  Huh? | No!
  The rocket from my croak dream! Oh, man. I guess... I guess this is it. I've gotta embrace this today!| Shushers, you're not getting on that rocket!  Err!  JAKE! 
  You can't stop destiny, Finn! | Jake, no! 
  Yeyuh!|  Aww!  Nooo! 
  Banana Man! Get your butt on board, we've got a date with destiny!| No! 
  Get off! You cant mess with fate!| No! I'm not gonna let you die!
  Finn!| Don't do this!
  Finn.| No!
  Finn, let me go.|  Please.  Please.
  You have to let me go.| No.  Please.
  There's not enough boom boom sticks in the stick hole! No!| Jake!
  Take care, brother. You weren't by my side in the croak dream but I'm glad you're here to see me off| That's right! I wasn't in his dream! That means...
  Ahhh!| Jake! Jake!!  Jake I'm coming with you! 
  Fiiiiiiinnn, don't try to stop me, Finn!| No, it's okay, I'm here to stay by your side! 
  Thanks man, I knew you'd come around.| 
  Poor Banana Man. So I guess that wasn't a real croak dream after all! It didn't really come together quite right.| Heh, heh yeah.
  Hey no wait, in the croak dream it was me and Banana Man,  but this time you were here too.  So...  it must be destined to happen again when your not around!| Well in that case, I'll just have to never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives.
  Hmm?  What are you doing?|  I can never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives.
   Get off of me!|  For the rest of our lives! 
  No!| I know where you live!
  No, c'mon!| Ooh! Ooh!
  Yeah!| And you buried the treasure right here?
  Uh-huh.| Jake! You're awesome!  So cool...
  Jake! You're awesome!  So cool...| A suitcase?! Oh, man!
  I found it at the dump and then buried it without lookin' inside.| Whoa. Wait a second, man. I know this case.
  Whoa! And I found it?| Mm-hmm.
  There. Now nobody will bother us.| Jake! Jake, come on!
  Jake! Jake, come on!| Okay. You can play this , right, BMO?
  Yes, Finn. It goes in my butt!| Oh.
   Dude... what are we watchin'?| I think it's the Ice King's diary.
  Can we fast-forward?| No, man, we might miss something.
  Hey, pause it, BMO.| There's gotta be some evil secrets in here. I wanna keep watching.
  Gunther, no! Gunther...  Dance pa—  GUNTHER!  Dance party! | Thanks, Gunther.
 Other| There's probably some evil secrets coming up.  Someone wants to see the secret tapes!
  Let's peek through the window and check who it is! Maybe it's just pizza.| Right!
  You guys are checking too loud!|  Oh! You're right.  More quietly!
  Aah!| Okay. If we're quiet long enough, Ice King will think no one's home and go away.
 Other| Just turn your alarm off!
  My alarm says it's time for Finn's bath. Finn, get naked.|  No, just hit your snooze button!
  I cannot self-snooze. It's against my programming.|  Well, then, tell me how to do it!
  Press and hold.  Then, press the button on top of my head.  I'm sorry. ...We can still take a bath...| He must know we're watching his tapes. We need to find his secrets faster.
  Oh, diary! Thank you for listening to me!| Fast-forward, BMO.
  I'm gonna take a nap...| No! These tapes are important! We just don't know why yet. BMO, fast-forward to triple speed!
  Okay.| BMO, play normal speed.
  Maybe he's talkin' in secret code.| Telling evil secrets in secret code... He's brilliant!
   Why don't we call others for help?| BMO, you're brilliant!
  Well, who do we call?| Um... The smartest person we know, Princess Bubblegum!  She's brilliant...
  Um... The smartest person we know, Princess Bubblegum!  She's brilliant...| Hey, Princess Bubblegum.
  Hey, Finn.| Jake and I found a bunch of secret tapes! We were wondering if you'd help us decode them.
  Oh, you called the right person. I know a lot about codes. Let's start with—| What?
   Ohh...| Hey, Princess. We got disconnected.
  Ice King is on the phone outside!|  So... how's the weather in Candy Kingdom?
 Other| The only thing that smells like penguins is you, Ice King!!
 Other| What're you doing?!
 Other| No, man!
 Other|  He doesn't know that we're watching his tapes. We gotta find these evil secrets before he uses them against us!
  ...AAAAAAAAAaaa  aaaloutte, gentille Alouette, Alouette, je te plumerai. Je te plumerai la tête! Je te plumerai la tête! Alouette,  je te plumerai!| Huh. I guess you do know all the words. Anyway, start the next video, BMO. We gotta crack the code on the Ice King's evil secret tapes!
  Huh. I guess you do know all the words. Anyway, start the next video, BMO. We gotta crack the code on the Ice King's evil secret tapes!| Brrrr... You guys cold?
  I think I can break the code, Finn.| Really?
  Yes. I have detected a noticeable pattern in the tears of sadness that fall from the Ice King's eyeballs.  His tears drop at an equal rate until the thirteenth tear, when the right eye drops two tears instead of one.| Whoa...
"  The thirteenth letter of the alphabet is ""M."" If I print the letter ""M"" every time the Ice King says an ""M"" word, it looks like this! "| Oh, my Glob, Jake... Is this it? Could this be the Ice King's evil secret?   WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!
 Other| No, man! I know you've got evil secrets on these, and we're gonna find 'em!
 Other|  Crip, Jake! We gotta unravel these evil secrets at warp-crazy!
 Other| Weird...  He's sneakin' in through the chimney!
  Finn! There is one more tape!| Play it! His evil secret must be on that tape!!
 Other| Wait, Ice King.  BMO, eject tape, please.  Here, Ice King.
 Other| No... It's... well... These belong to you.
  Uh...| How about once a year?
  It's just a jam sesh. Is that what you're gonna jam with?| Yeah, man. Balloon music is the future. Listen. 
  Pretty good.  I don't think you mastered it yet.| Well, duh. I just started.
  Oh, dude. There's a note.| What's it say?
"   ""Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back,"" blee-bloo-blop, ""Don't go in my house."""| That's it?
"  Yeah. Just ""Don't go in my house"" in all caps... written in blood."| Hmm.  What are you doing?
  Eliminating desire from my heart. It helps pass the time.| Come on! I can't do that! Let's play Cloud Hunt 'til she gets here.
  No, man, I got a mental block with Cloud Hunt!| Yeah, that's what makes it awesome, 'cause I know I'll win.
  Oh, what?! Bring it on, brother! Now explain the rules 'cause I forget.| Okay. I count to ten and you go hide somewhere. Then, I gotta try to find you. You can hide... anywhere in here. Anywhere in here, ...but Marcy's house is off limits because she said so. Okay?
  Got it.| Okay. I'm gonna start counting. Ready?
   Yes.| Go! One...  Two... Three... Four... Five... Four...
  Go! One...  Two... Three... Four... Five... Four...| Cloud Hunt... GOTCHA! Huh. Hmm.  AH-HA!  JAKE!  Get out of there! Marceline's gonna kill you! Jake! I know this isn't a mirror. What the—?! You're doing it wrong, even! Get out! Get out!!  Dude, get out of there! She's gonna kill us! She'll be home any minute! Did you read the note?! I mean, you read the note! You told it to me!! 
  She's gonna kill us. Once she finds out she's gonna tie us up and eat us like a spider.| You don't think I know that?! Hmmmmmmm... We'll wait for the right moment and sneak out... right under her big, fat caboose.
  Okay, man. I can do this.  Egh! Egh! Egh!!| Shh, here she comes!
  Here she comes...| Shh, shh!!
  Is someone here?|  Shh!!
  Whatcha doin'?|"  Get down.  Love, FINN + JAKE""] When she gets this, she'll leave and we can escape!"
  Brilliant... but how's it gonna work?| I'll fly the paper as an airplane down the bedroom ladder. It'll triple barrel roll past the kitchen, open the fridge, and cook some eggs, then eat the eggs, and unfold itself as it lays in the carpet in front of Marceline's door!
   We've crossed the line! I'm gettin' outta here, man!| Yeah! Do it!
  Yeah! Do it!| What? What's it doing?!
    Stupid... thing— Get...  NO! Stupid—  UGH!!   Ugh!| Is it safe?
  What happened, man?|  I'm not goin' back out there.
  Well... whaddaya mean? What happened?  Bro?| Is she awake?
  Why are you talking?!| I'm wondering if she's awake.
  Well, if she's awake, she can definitely hear you talking!| I'm whispering.
  Dude, I think she sees us!| What the—?! DUDE! You shape-changed to look like me?! 
  HEY!  Exssssplain yourselves.|  We were playing hide-and-seek in your closet and you came home, so we hid in there all day. We saw... everything. And, oh, Glob, I mean, whatever you do to us, I just wanna say, we're sorry.
  Anyways, no hard feelings, guys! See you soon!| Marceline?  Jake! Jake!
  Hmm?  Hey, man, did—| AAAAAAH!!
  | It's slippin', dude.
  It's slippin', dude.| Phew.  Raini-corni-copia? An Unabridged History of the Rainicorns.  Whatever, man. I barely even made it through the title.
  | Huh.  Oh.  Hey, this table is wobbly. We gotta take it to the Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain to fix it.
  Dude, I would love to go on some crazy, made-up adventure with you, but I really gotta read this. So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you. | I don't make up adventures! Jake, you know that! Jake! I don't make up adventures!  Hm.  Books, books.  Kitties, Zitties, Witties, Mitties, Knitties, Fitties, Hitties, Jitties, Pities, Cities...  Oh, no! Damaged books? Who did this?!
  Shhhhhhhushh!| Sorry.  I will avenge thee, slightly-soiled books. Gotta tell Jake.
  Sorry.  I will avenge thee, slightly-soiled books. Gotta tell Jake.| Hello?  Is someone back here? Are you stuck?
  Shhhushmm!|  Hello?  Whoa! Ohhh! Hey, there's pages comin' outta these books!
  SHHHHHH!| Who are you dudes?
  I am Paper Pete, the leader of the Pagelings. But you can call me P.P.| I'll call you Pete.
  Okay!| Why are you dudes in the library?
  We are the secret guardians of the books in the library. You know those blank pieces of paper in the beginning of old books?| Yeah?
  That's us! We revealed ourselves to you, noble giant, because you felt our plight when you saw the damaged books. And now is our darkest hour, for the Moldos have been growing more bold with every attack. Look at the damage done yesterday  at the Battle of Teddy Bear Joke Book.| Wow, yeah.
  They're massing for a full-scale assault on every book in the library!| Gosh! Even the Rainicornicopia?
  Yes.| I better tell Jake. Don't you dudes go anywhere.
  Okay.| Hey, bro, I've got an adventure—and it's not made up! There are these- these Pagelings they came out from- from books! And they- they folded into little animals.
  Hey, bro, I've got an adventure—and it's not made up! There are these- these Pagelings they came out from- from books! And they- they folded into little animals.| Do you hear what I'm saying?!
   Shhhh!| You think I'm making this up?
   | I'll prove it to you! 
  Finn!  Finn, you butt chicken!| Jake, wait till you see 'em.
  Jake, wait till you see 'em.| Ow.
  | They were just here! Pagelings?
  They were just here! Pagelings?| Why didn't you dudes introduce yourselves to Jake?
  We don't want to reveal ourselves to anyone else. We are the secret guardians. Secret.| Ummmm... yeah, but Jake is a powerful giant like me! He can help you battle or- or whatevs! But first, you must win his favor. Do you not want victory for your people?
  Yes! We do want victory!| C'mon, follow me.  Jake, look.
  C'mon, follow me.  Jake, look.|  He's up here reading a book.
   He's up here reading a book.| Do something to get his attention.
  Hoo-ah!| Okay.
  | Jake, the Pagelings are dancing for you. Just look up for a second!
  By wearing the beast,  we shall become like the beast. | You can feel them, can't you?
  I can feel you pinching me.| Just look up for a second!  Looooook.  Uhhh. Pagelings, I'm sorry, but my friend is acting like a clump.
  Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else!| I'm not making believe!
  | 
  Yes, leave! Victory! Veni, vidi, vici!| So, those little squishy guys are the Moldos?
  Mettle!| Uh-huh. They seem tough.
  Their bites sting like the Dickens.| Hmmm... their bites sting, eh? I've got a plan, Pete.
  Tell me your plan, giant.| Just trust me.  Trust me.
  You've discovered the Moldos' Secret Lair!| Eh, it wasn't very hard.
  Eh, it wasn't very hard.| Wibba-wibba-wah!
  | Whoa. Whoa, moldy blobs. I've come here to help the Moldos defeat the Pagelings.
  Traitor!  Hiyah! Yah!|  Calm down, this is part of my plan.
  How are we to trust you?| Well... here, look.  I brought you all a prisoner. It's their leader.
  May you rot in Tartarus! May your skin boil and eyes burst into flames... forever in a pit! | 
  Traitor!| So, do you guys have, like, a—like, a leader or somethin'?
  I'm Mildwin, leader of the Moldos.| Oh, uhh... hmm.  Nice to meet you, your highness.
  I'm not a king; I was democratically elected.|  That's adorable.  Now, Finn! 
  Well played, ol' giant.  You have the cunning of Odysseus. | Pete, j-just stop winking.  Hyah!
  Shhhh!| Ignore this! 
  AAAAH! AAH!| Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
  What did you do to me?! AAAAAAH!| Ummm...
  AH! AAAH!| Uhhh... come on, you guys, knock it off.
  | The Moldos got a taste for ya now.
  |" Gotta do something. Where can I find ways to solve problems in a library?  ""Books""?  Books! Books! Books!"
  Aaah!|  Huh? Whatcha nibblin' me for?
  This sweaty stuff tastes amazing. A-mazing!| Hmmm. Tastier than battle beast fur. Yis! 
  Hmmm. Tastier than battle beast fur. Yis! | Hey, Mildwin. Mildwin!
  What?| I bring a peace offering from the Pagelings.
  Finn... what's happening?| Hang on, buddy. Paper Pete?
  Giant! Have you wiped out the Moldo horde?| Naw, man. The war's over.  Mildwin, you can keep my shirt if  you don't attack their library books.
  Agreed, beast. This filthy garb will feed my people for generations.| And in forty years, you can have my shorts. Sound good, Pete?
  It will suffice.| Sound good, Jake?
   AAAH! What—What the hecks, man?! What'd you do to me?!|  Look, man! Moldos and Pagelings are real!
  Wha—? Who cares, man?! I'm outta here!| Did you finish your Rainicorn book?
  Ugh... I was readin' the same paragraph over and over for, like, eleven minutes. I guess I'm gonna give up on learnin' everything about Rainicorn history. Don't tell Lady.| Oh. What about relating to your mixed-species kids?
  Eh, I'll just fake it.| Oh. Well... hey, man, I think I see some, um...  Sun People in trouble on the sun over there.
  You makin' that up?| Mmhmm.
  Yeah! Let's do it! |  WHOO! WHOOOO!
  Who wants a cookie?  Milk-dipped chocolate chip cookie?| No thanks.
  Now, come on, Finn. You have to eat. Open Sesame...| Uh, Jake, can't we get rid of these Clown Nurses? They make me feel ridiculous.
  Time for our love therapy.| Wait, what are they doing?  Whoa! Stop!
   Oh my! Did that hurt, dear?| NO!! I just don't want you kissing my toe!
"  Now, now, honey, you gotta understand. This is the only way to ""foo-foo"" your boo-boo."| What does that even mean??
  No, keep going. |  You're gross, man.  Look! Deep in the forest of trees, there's a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound. See? See?
  Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals, and my professional prescription is... your toe needs crazy smooches! It's the only way! | Huh? Wha?
  Huh? Wha?| Wait! Wait! Wait! There's another way! There's my way! Let me show you my way!
  Wait! Wait! Wait! There's another way! There's my way! Let me show you my way!| Ahh! Let me go! 
   It's the only way!| MY WAY!!
  MY WAY!!| Hmmm...
  Ring, ring! Look, there's only two choices, bro. Take your pick. There's the path on the left, Hair Fall-Out Path. No more hair again, ever! Or the path on the right, Smelly Path. Makes you smelly forever. Hoohoo, you won't believe it.| Isn't there another way?
  Nope.| But what if I just went—
  Hey, listen man, the Smelly Path's not actually that bad!| NO! I choose MY WAY!!  My way.
  Ring ring. Hello, dummy police? Yes, there's a strange dummy lurking around my house. Okay, yes. Thank you. Goodbye.| Wha...?  I need to cross the river. The Cyclops is over there.
  You can't cross this river. It's impossible! Look! The current is so fast, it'll turn your butt inside-out for real, doofus. And the water's so acidic it'll crump your boat in half. It's like orange juice. It's gross. There's a bridge, but it's a trap! Plus, the water's jamming with electric eels. Wow, so weird. Anyway, that's it, there's no other way around, you dummy.| But I need to get across.
  Listen what I'm telling you. There's no way. ...Ugly tramp.| Glob, Glob it, Glob it, Glob it...
"  Huh? What are you saying? ""Globbit, Globbit""? Who's Globbit?"| MY WAY!!
  Glibby glob, man! You're crazy! We're not even half way across! You gotta go back, man! It's the only way, you ugly fat-smelling fat-head!| NO, MY WAY!! 
  NO, MY WAY!! |  MY WAY!  Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob.
  Uhh, excuse me, friend.  You're pretty tall, can you reach up there and get my wheel for me? Gotta get these melons home to my wife. You know how it is.|  MY WAY! 
   Rainy!| Whoops. Uh... man, I'm real sorry.
  Yeah?  No doy... friend.| But... I can still help. I'll fix your house for you.
  Just get out of here! Leave us alone!| Uh... wh... I... 
  Psycho fink.| ♫ I was wrong. Was I wrong? No. Yes... Yes... I was wrong. How could it be? I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts. I was wrong. How could it be? Listened to my brain, but ended up insane. The melons rolled...over that lady. I went too far. How could it be?  How did I go... too far? ♫
  Hey! I know you're here for my magical tears, but you won't have any, because I never cry.| I don't want 'em anymore.
  What? Stop lying. You're here for my tears, aren't you?| No. I hurt a small, hairy man's wife. I just wanna go home.
  You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry... but I've got a heart of stone, buddy. I'm EVIL!| Dude! What's wrong with you? I said I don't want your tears!
  YOU'RE LYING!| I'M NOT LYING!!!
   You stink at lying.| Fine. Whatever, man. Have it your way.
  Okay... I WILL HAVE IT MY WAY!!| Huh? 
  Beg for mercy, or I'll kill you!| 
  Whuh... What?| 
  What? I can't hear you.| I said... MY WAY!!
  I said... MY WAY!!| Magical tear drops.  My way can still work! Yeah!
  Have you come crying back for your proper treatment, Babylips?| Kiss that!
  Bittersweet.| Hey, man. You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo?
  Ah, no thanks. I think the kisses work better.  Excuse me, don't stop, keep going, please. | You're gross.
  Hey! We all have our own ways.|  You know what? You're... right.
  Mm, oh boy.| How much Softy Cheesy for ya deezy? A little? A lot?
  Blech! None!| But you used to love Softy Cheese!
  I don't wanna talk about it.| What was that?
  Probably an owl.  Mm... Mm, mm...  A ghost!!| Dude. It's just Ghost Princess. Hey, GP.   She's weird, huh?  How's it goin'?
  Oh, okay.|  Well, could ya knock it off??
  Until I discover the cause of my death, my soul can't ascend to the 50th Dead World. But as a ghost, I have no memory of my mortal life... and no idea how I died...|  It's a crime case!
  Whoa, step back, nephew. We don't know she was moidered!| That's right. We don't even know how she was moida'd, but I'm the hard-boiled sleuth who's gonna crack your case wiiiide open!
  Well... here's me.|" Our first clue!  ""Female."" It's a good start, but we need more. Jake, it's time to interrogate the neighbors. We'll do it good cop bad cop style. I CALL BAD COP!"
  Awww...| Yo, ghost! Yo, yo! Yo, wake up, fool! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
  What?!?!| Yo, ghost, whaddaya know about the lady buried next to you?
  I don't think so, m'lady, but I am honorèd.| Whadda you know about Ghosty-pees gettin' murdle-lurdled?
  Did you try looking yonder?  That's where the ne'er-do-well ghosts hang out.| Right... Ne'er-do-wellers. Let's do this, Jake.
   You stay, and eat cheese puffs!| Geez. Look at this place. It's all bunked up.
  Yeah, no wonder this is where the ne'er-do-wells go when they deezy. I got a feelin' these ghosts are gonna be harder to shake than Boilbee.| Yeah, well get ready, 'cause this biz is gonna get ridonk.
  Cool, man. Hey, can I be bad cop now?| No. Okay, let's check this guy out.
  What's it say?|"  ""Some donkus."" WAKE UP, DONKUS! WE GOT QUESTIONS! DINGUS! TIME TO SING, YA CANARY!  BAM!! YAH!  What'chu know about Ghost Princess, huh?! Give it up, Dungus!"
  Hey, man, take it easy.|  You do your job, I do mine!  TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW, PUNK!! Uh-oh.  What's this? A busted knife. Is this your knife, bro? TELL ME!!!  Jake, good cop...
  Alright. Cool off, bad cop!  This ghost ain't home, man!|  Well, you're lucky my partner's here... pal.
  He's not worth it, man.|  These ghosts think I'm playin'. They think it's all a big game. But you know what? You know what I'm gonna do?
  What?| I'm gonna turn this game... UP-SIDE-DOWN!!! 
  I'm talking... about you, Princess.| YYYYAAAAAH!!  GHOSTS! YOU GHOSTS! COME OUT! 
  I think this place is abandoned, man.| They're just hidin' 'cause they know they're guilty!
  Yo! Yo! That's my grave! Why're you fops trashin' our spot?!|  We thought you were... hiding.
  Kill these fools!| BRING IT ON, YOU MAMAS!
  Phew! Thanks, Clarence!| Yo, I'm sorry we haven't solved the case yet.
  It's alright, Finn... I'm calling off the investigation.| What? Why?
  I don't feel tormented anymore now that I'm with Clarence.| Oh. That's... that's cool.
  Let's go to my private mausoleum where we can be... private. | Yugh!
   Thanks for your help...!| A'ight.   Man... I wanted to crack the case, y'know?
  Look on the bright side, guy! We looted all this sweet grave booty! Ka-ching! | Jake! You looted?! That's bad, man! You're supposed to be good cop.
  Oops... I didn't know it was wrong.| Come on, let's put all this stuff back.
  What?! All of it?!|" Yes, Jake.  Huh. This dagger says, ""Rence."""
  What's that?| I guess some donkus's real name was...  ReeeeEEEENCE?!!
  What is it, dude??|  ...We gotta dig up the princess.
   ...We gotta dig up the princess.|" Look!  Sorry.  Lookit!  ""Cla-rence."" Clarence was some donkus!"
  STOP!| Clarence is your murdler!
  CITIZEN'S ARREST!  Hey, be careful, man!!| So that's why you don't like Softy Cheese!
  Congratulations, you kids!| Haha, yeah!
   Thanks for everything! Goodbye!| You sure you're ready for this, man?
  Yeah. Gimme one a' them cheesy dogs, man.| All gone?  Lemme see. Move your tongue left...
   Wah-vah.| ...And right.
   Vah.| I'm proud of you, pal. Real proud.
  Alright. Whaddaya wanna see next?| A cheetah! A fart!
  A cookie! An external hard drive! Ooh, ooh! Change into Finn, but give him my body!| BMO, your ideas are boring.
 Alright, I'll try to turn into a cheetah farting.  I can't do the spots.| Sparkles on the house? LET'S SQUISH 'EM!
  Did you squish the sparkles?| No. They're around this holo-message player. It's got a cartridge with it.
  Oh, snap!  Well, plop that cartridge in the slot, playah!| Yeah! Okay! 
  Dude, take your hands off your head.| WHAT?!?!
  Alright, boys. Now to give you some incentive, at the end of the dungeon, I'm going to put the Family Sword. It's made out of Demon's Blood.| Whoa, what the--?!
  Whoa!!| Geez-louise!
  The dungeon's eighty paces west of here under a dumb-lookin' rock. And Finn, this dungeon's gonna kick your tail. I bet you won't even get past the first trial, ya whiny baby!| What?? What was that about?
  Duh... duh... du-ugh... duh...| Whoo! 
  Whoa! Burgers and hotdogs! Yeah, yeah, YEAH! | Wait, Jake!
   But... burgers and hotdogs..| Didn't you say you were hungry for burgers this morning?
  Yeah, so?| And I said I was hungry for hotdogs?
  Mm-hmm, I remember.| I don't think those burgers and hotdogs are burgers and hotdogs at all.
  Aaaahh...|  DUDE!!  Look!
  Finn, cover up those nubs on your head.| Man... again? 
  Remember, Jake, this is a prerecorded holo-message. I can't hear you if you're talking to me right now.|  I'm gonna go walk around!
   Finn!| Over here!  Check it out, Jake. I found two ways. This way has some kinda flower trap, and that way... has that guy.
  Ugh... Let's take the flower path!|  Mmm.
  Oh... | Cheer up, man. We're only tellin' you you're gross because we're your bros.
  Really?| Yeah! Bros are real with each other, and you're gross, brother. Take a bath.
  Thanks, brother. Hahaha.| Hahaha, no probs.  Hey, what did Dad say?
  Um... He said he's surprised a whiny baby like you made it this far.| What?! Why's Dad sayin' all that jive??
   Because... you cry like a baby... Baby!| Dude... you're pickin' on me, too?
    Whoa.| I don't even cry much. I only cry when it's healthy, like when people die.
  Partake of the fruit... | Pff, blech... If I didn't cry when people died, I'd have a cold butt for a heart.
  Partake of the fruit!|  Maybe I will partake of the fruit.
  Dude, don't eat that!!| Why not? All the people that I care about in this world are being wads.
  Don't you blow Poppy's cover!| Whoa. 
  Time to go, baby.  Finn, come on!| I'm gonna hang here. With these fruit babes. They'll be my best buds now.
"  You're not real.  Dad asked me to call you ""Baby"" because he wants you to be tough."| But I'm tough! My whole body is a callus!
   On this next holo-message we listen to, when Dad tells you to cover your ears, don't. |  Hmmph.
  DAD!|  Dad's sword!
  Finn!  Dude! Use your karate biz!| Ugh... I—  I can't, man. I suck. I'm a whiny baby, and I'm fat, and all those things Dad said about me!
  You know I don't think you're a baby, right?| Yeah. I know.
  That sword is sweet!| Yeah! I'm stoked to slay some evil with it.
  NOOOOOOO!!! | Man... Dad was cool.
  Isn't it cool, Finn?|  Owwww-guh...
  It's letting up. Hey, Finn, come on, let's go do something.| 
  Finn, I'm going out for a quick.... walk in the woods.| 
   Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry!|  BMO, go away! 
  | Who lit that fire?! I'll kill you!
  Who lit that fire?! I'll kill you!|  Yaaah! 
   Yaaah! |  Bubblegum's rockets!  Don't you touch her stuff!!!
  | It's a girl.
  You! What's wrong with me, huh?! You don't like me?!|  I like you!
  Don't ever mess with me again!|  Who was that?
   The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?|  Dude, I think I have a crush.
  Don't ever mess with me again!|  Who was that?
   The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?|  Dude, I think I have a crush.
   Dude, I think I have a crush.| What do you know about her, Jake?
  I was trying to help you get over your Princess Bubblegum sad times by hooking you two up. But she's evil, man!| You shut your dirty mouth! 
  Dirty?  Oh. No, really man! Her dad said she was evil!| Naw, man, I peeped beyond her burning gaze, and noshed hot lunch with her soul.  She ain't evil. She's passionate. Help me track her down.
  Hmmm..| C'mon, man, I really like her. Help me out.  Jake, Jake help me out. Help me out. Jake, Jake, help me. Jake, Jake, help me!
  Eeeeeeeeehhh, ok.| Whoo! Alright!
  You sure you're not into any other princesses? What about Wildberry Princess? She's small and plump. You could sleep on her like a pillow. Could be nice.| Is that bird... smoking?
  | Oh, Jake... look at her. She's innocent. Like the steam off a puppy's nose, searching for ham in the snow.
  Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it! Snap out of it! She's burning cute little flowers!|  Yeah, she is like a cute little flower.
  Aaahh!|  Oh, no, are you ok?
  | I... I was just worried about you.
  Huh?| Look, I'm sorry about what I said before. I don't know what happened, but I just, I had to see you again. And, I don't know.. I don't know anything about you,  but I just, I really like you. You know, you're so... beautiful.
  Look, I'm sorry about what I said before. I don't know what happened, but I just, I had to see you again. And, I don't know.. I don't know anything about you,  but I just, I really like you. You know, you're so... beautiful.|  Whoa!
  Ow!| Oh, Glob. Am I hurting you?
  Yes! That's all you've done!  Are you trying to hurt me?! Is that why you're following me?!| I'm not followi-- Well, I guess technically I am following you.
  | Hey, no wait! 
  Hey, no wait! |  I guess now I'm technically chasing you. 
  Eaoww.. Toasty buns. | Where are you? I want to chat it up with you! Oh, we lost her!
  Where are you? I want to chat it up with you! Oh, we lost her!| Whoa.
  Aah!| Hey, I like your fireballs.
  Huh? Why do you torment me?| I'm not trying to. I just like you. I think I... I think I like-like you. Listen, when I look at you, my brain goes all stupid. And I just wanna hug you, and sit on the couch and play BMO with you. I can't explain why, but, I never felt this way before and I think we should be together.
  I... |  Yeah.
  Rggh! Enough. You should not toy with the emotions of a fire elemental.| Wait wait, I really didn't--
  You're trying to impede me. That must be your purpose, ...but fire's purpose is to burn, so I'm going to turn this land into my fire kingdom!| No!
  She's headed for Goblin Kingdom! We need to defeat this fiery she-beast!| I can't fight her, man. I'm still into her!
  Finn, what's more important? Your love for that screwball dame, or being a hero and savin' the lives of innocent goblin folks?| Rrrrhh.. Being a hero.
  Alright, c'mon! Let's go build fire-proof suits.|  Uh-uh-uh, I gotta' get back to her.
   Oh, plops, we forgot about the game.| Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...
  I missed you, creator.| And we missed you, too, but Neptr, right now we need you to--
  To count to 100 while you hide? 1, 2,.. 3, 4, 5--| Neptr, will you help us build fire-proof suits?
  I am finished!| I sure hope Flame Princess is okay.
  Haha, we are as one, creator.| Jake, you think Flame Princess is okay?
  DUUUUDE! I feel like I can touch the heavens!  And sock angels!| We're coming up on the Goblin Kingdom.
  We're coming up on the Goblin Kingdom.| There she is.
  There she is.| She seems okay.
  It's really starting to come together. Needs more... fire... hmm.| Flame Princess!
  Flame Princess!| Listen, you gotta stop burning the Goblin Kingdom, ...but I don't wanna fight you or hurt you, I swear.
  Ah!| Aah! Jake didn't mean that!
  Ah! Whyyyy?!| No, Jake, stop. You're hurting her!
  I will solve this, creator. I will extinguish her using our suit! Foam blaster.  Hold still, burning lady.| Wha?
  Locked on target.|  No, Neptr!
  Yes, creator.| NOOOO!
  AH!|  I'm sorry!
  That is the last time you hurt me.  RAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!| My bad, Jake! Turn it off, Neptr!
  My bad, Jake! Turn it off, Neptr!| 
  Oh, my...| NO!
  RAAAAAAAAAHH! | No more... No more!  FLAME PRINCESS!
  No more... No more!  FLAME PRINCESS!| I can't fight her, ...but I can't let her destroy the city... I've failed everyone.
  Mmm! | No. Why can't I just like a girl? 
  Ow!  Huh?| 
   Oh.|  Wah! Did I... do something... cool while I was knocked out?
  I understand now. You're a water elemental.| What?
  You're my opposite. You create water.| What, cry? No, I j--
  Yeah, you cry and cry all the time.| N-No. I-I don't usually do that.
  That's your power.| No! N-N-N-NO-NO-NO! 
  Finn, even if we like each other, we're going to hurt each other.| No, we don't have to. I can take it... I... I mean, can't we try?
  You would defy nature for me?| Uh... yeah, whatevs.
  Uh... yeah, whatevs.| Aaah.. Uh.
  FINN!  Oh my Glob, man. Everyone's dead, man! They're all burned. There's barbecued bods EVERYWHERE!| WHAAAAT!?!
  So. How'd everything go with Flame Princess?| She hugged me... then left.
  Whoa! How did it feel?|  It hurt.
  No, I don't need anything. Thank you. Okay, goodbye, Finn and Jake!| Bye, BMO!
  What the...?| See, man? I told you.
  This is nuts. Plus, he's usin' my toothbrush!| No, man. That's my toothbrush. 
   UGH!|"  ""Prove that BMO does weird junk when nobody is around."" Check! "
  High-five, buddy!| That was pretty weak.
  Yeah. I was thinkin' the same thing.| You wanna give it another go?
  Yeah.| That was better... but we can do better.
  You mean even better.| Let's back on up and run at each other!
  Ooh, kinda stings!| I like the pain.
  Let's do another one.| Ready!?
  Yeah!| Jake!
  Yeah?| I know how we can do the most ultimate high-five ever!!
  You've gone crazy mad with power lust! And I'm lovin' it!!|  You ready to do this, dude!?
   I've been ready this whole time, dude! Just waitin' you to say when you're—| SUPER-ULTIMATE HIGH-FIVE GO!!!
  WHAT?!?!|  Awesome...
  Yo, Finn, look what I found!  A vertical trampoline! It's sticky!| Dude, it's a spider web.
  Ohh. Well, cut me out, yo!| No way, I'll stunt you out! Whoah!  ...I was thinking something else would happen.
  You got anything sharp?| The only sharp thing I had was my fingernails, but you made me cut them.
  Augh! You broke the skin, dude!| I guess my fingernails are really loaaeaeuAAAAHH--! 
  I guess my fingernails are really loaaeaeuAAAAHH--! | Oh, yeah. Sorry.
  It's cool, man.| Can you... stretch us out of here?
  That's the circle of life.| That's not a circle. That's, like, a straight line.
  We don't make the rules, man.| Well, don't just give up.
  Try to stay calm. Greet your fate with dignity.| We gotta go, Jake! Jake!
  Well, go ahead then. Wrap them up for laters.  What's wrong, Barb?| What's going on there, Jake? 
  Oh, get stuffed, Ed! | You guys are sad.  Ugh! What is that sound? Sick, dude! She makes that sound, too?
  Yeah, I guess, but she never does it in front of me.  Anyway, it's not gross when guys do it.| Dude, that's not cool. You need to think about what you say and how that affects your lady.
  It's hard to step outside of yourself when you're enmeshed with another being. . Oh, Grod! It's over! It's over!!| Wait!
  What?| Umm...  Right now, we gotta real-talk about your girlfriend.
  I don't real-talk with my food.| Uhh...  We real-talk now, or you're going to be as single as your stinky web squirter!
  Yeah, right. You just wanna get out of my web. All you ever want to do is escape! You're always, like, in cahoots, makin' plans not to be food.| I'm not in cahoots!
  So okay, eat your friend here. |  Okay.
  No, man! What?! Where's your heart?! Look inside yourself! This isn't you!|  I'm gonna fake eat you, man.
   Okay, man, you've earned my trust. So, let's do this. Real-talk me, bro! |  Okay, first off, then, how you're going about this isn't working. Am I right?
  Ugh, yeah. It's not working. My way sucks.|  Cool, now we've gotta do damage control. Healing the negs energy at the source.
  Yes, heal the neg-jerseys in me.|  Alright, uhh...
   Alright, uhh...|  Go find Barb a present. That'll fix the first neg. Can you do that?
  Whee!| You're free!  Aw, man.
  It's okay, Finn. You bought us some time.| Yeah, think fast, what can we use?
  There's nothing! Just a bunch of nature.| I have a dumb idea.
  Yo what?| Shoot!
  My eyes! Agh!! | Ha ha, yes! Finally! 
  Good job! Last chance for life. Break out!|  Yeah, you mommy!
  Hey, what's going on here! | Nothing.  Oh, crab apples!
  Where's Ed?|" Oh, uh, he's getting you an ""I'm sorry"" gift."
   I'm gonna eat you!| Yo, that's wrong!
  Oh, no. You got that look on your face. You going back to help that fool?| His wife's gonna eat him!
  You little twerp! Are you stupid or something?| Yeah, I'm stupid. But I know something real. You shouldn't eat your husband!
   Yo, smoothin' things out?| Not exactly...
   Barb! Barb! What's wrong, my love?  Okay ...| What is happening!?
  Oh, Ed. We're parents!| Aw, sick!
  Nice.| Think they're gonna make it?
  Oh man! Alright, what's next?| Haha, let's see...  First we visit Tree Trunks for apple pie, and then we go to Bubblegum's science music thing!
  Wait, what about the movie at the drive-in?| That's after we make dream sandwiches!
  Whoo!  Let's go, apple pie!|  Whoo!
   Whoo!|  Tree Trunks!
  TT!| Tree Trunks!
  Hmmm.| Cool.
  Oh, you.| Where's the apple pie, Tree Trunks?
   I love her so much.| WHOA! You love 'er?!
  Whaa? No!|  You just said you love 'er.
   I think I am in love with her! But I don't know how to go about it... | Dude, you should just tell her how you feel!
   Where is she? | You givin' me a back rub, bro?
  Huh? Oh, gross!| Hyeah! Break it up, break it up! Okay, the love show is over! Princess, please continue.
  Why's everybody givin' me the hairy eyeball?| Y'all are too affectionate. It makes people feel... bothered when you and the Pig your affection in public!
  They don't want us to flaunt what we have?| You two need to hide your love... or else, you'll end up making the whole world throw up!
  We promise to keep our affection hidden.| Thank you.
  Have you seen my other shoe?| I think I saw it in the closet!
   You shouldn'ta bought so many flavors! I had to make a sandwich for each flavor, and for each flavor combination!| I'm makin' a cheese sandwich!  Tree Trunks! Pig! Come on!
   Try harder!|  Doesn't look like Tree Trunks and Pig are around!
  Aw, man!|  Just try to ignore it and watch the movie!
  Stoooooop!| Tree Trunks, this has gone on long enough! No more spending time with the Pig, unless you do it, inside your own home.
  But Finn, an unmarried couple living together one roof, that's indecent!| Then, why don't you two just get married?
  -we need time to get to know each other.| Then I guess we only have one option.
  Then I guess we only have one option.| Alright. 
  Little dove!|  Sorry, Tree Trunks.
  I don't know what I'm going to do without him, Finn!| Why don't you make apple pie to take your mind off of it?
   I close my eyes, and feel his arms around me, in my dreams... he's not so far away.|  Go to him.
  I'm freaking out!!| You know what? I like it. It's nice.
 |Oh. Heh heh. What? Where are we?
 I dunno.|What did we do last night?
 Mayhaps we drank juice of the Elder Toad.|Eh, I doubt it. Yo, do you see this? We're in a cage! Do you think we, like, did something wrong?
 Yeah, right. When did we ever did wrong actions? Get real. |Who ya calling?
 I'm callin' BMO, see if he knows what happened.  Junk... My new camera phone... Wait, c'mere!|What?
 I guess I vid-taped a buttload of stuff on here.|Play it for the clues within.
 Alright, let's do—|Oh, no! What?!
 Battery crunked out.|Dude, do you remember any of that mess?
 No, but I guess we're here on purpose?|So we opened a portal to somewhere, but where? 
 You're in the Nightosphere.|Are you sure?
 Look!|
 |Marceline's dad! We really are in the Nightosphere!
 Up an' at em, people.  Eveyone out of your cages. My shift is over, and no one's shown up, so...|Whoa, wait. You're letting us go?
 I mean... yeah, but not really. You're in the nightosphere, so...|So what?
 |Hey, c'mon! Just tell us how we can get back to our world.
 Hunson Abadeer?  Alright.|Well, dude, how do we talk to him?
 You can't just talk to the boss. You gotta make an appointment.|Yeah, but we don't even know why we're here!
  Hey! Hey! Is there an outlet anywhere? You guys...|Maybe this is where they put all the dummy demons.  Right, big guy? You're not so smart, right? Yeah...  Let's go out that hole, man.
 Okay, get on.|Mm-hm, mm-hm. Pretty neat.
 Mm-hm, mm-hm. Pretty neat.|Whoa, look!
 Daddy!|What is that?
 I think it's like sentient blood mist.|Cool.
 C'mon, let's see if anyone knows where Hunson Abadeer is.|Alright, well, how about that dude? 
 Okay.| Yo, bros! How do we talk to Hunson Abadeer?
  The teller can help you. Get in my flipping belly, and I will transport you. My insides are habitable. You will not be digested.|Bye, mister!  Who's the teller? That guy? 
 I can't, dude. This outbox is packed tighter than my tummy tunnel when I can't make brown on the camping trips because of my anxieties and I have IBS also.  Ow!|Hey, guy, are you the teller?
 No, no, no, this is the line to meet the teller.|No, man, are you for real? How long's the wait?!
 I dunno. I just like to row around on top of their heads.|Bunk that!
 I... ew, no.  Sick.|Why do we need to see the teller anyway? We just wanna see Hunson Abadeer and find out what happened to us!
 Youse ain't special! Youse gotta wait just like the rest of youse...  Us.| Where's the line start?
  That guy stinks.| Excuse me! Excuse me! Big man? Over here!
 Huh? What, me?|Uh, yeah, how long have you been in line for?
 How... long? |Oh, butt traps. Jake, stretch us to the front.
 I will kill you with all my hopes and regrets!|All right, dudes, chill! We'll wait! 
 I... can't. I got nothing to say anymore.|Just make up words then!
 Woohoo!| Yo, yo! We wanna talk to Abadeer!
 Wha... Huh?  When your thingy comes up, Hunson Abadeer will see you through the door.| 42 million?! What's the number on the door?
 41 million...  We're next! Whew! Man, I thought I was gonna throw up!|That's us!
 Yaaay!  Nooooooo!|I'm gonna lose it! Waaaaaaaaaaahhh... 
 What's going on, buddy? You givin' up?| I guess.
 You don't wanna just stick it out a little more?|I don't know if my little boy heart can take it.
 Listen, Finn. Are you listening?|Mm-hmm.
 Your heart may be small, but it's strong as a bull donk. And I know. You can wait through this line so we can meet Hunson Abadeer and find out why we're here, and why we're in a pile of banianials, 'cause you're a champ, OK?| Ok.
" 上手で頑張ってね (""Being that you are skilled you can do it!"")"|Well, at least I can see the end of the line, I think. Let's wait the heck out of this line!
 That's it, champ.  Hehehehe, you're pretty pumped up.|I'm super pumped!
  Put your hand down, Finn!|No way, dude, I got questions.
 No way, dude, I got questions.|What the hey, Jake!
 It's not answering questions, man. That thing is gonna bake our beans.| Hey, bloodmist cloud! What happened to us? Why can't we remember any—? Oh, it's gone.
 Ride me, partner. |Hey, cloud! Where's Abadeer? Whoa, look at all these paintings. I think this is Hunson Abadeer's house.
 Hey!|Hunson Abadeer!
 We just wanna go home, man.|Yeah, why'd you lock us up, Abadeer? When Marceline finds out about this, it's gonna stir up some heavy daddy-daughter issues.
 Finn!|Oh, my lob, Jake! You found the portal!
 |What the—?
 I'm gonna close this portal.  You're forbidden to come back to the Nightosphere!|But Marcy, let us help you!
 It's too late! Stay away from me, FOREVVVEEERRRR!!!! |Marceline's in trouble! We gotta go back and save her.
  Yo yo yo yo, check it! This is Jake on my camera phone!  Whooooooooooaaaaaaa. Whoooa! Yo, Finn! Say 'hi' to my new camera phone!| Whaddup camera phone!
  You guys wanna come party in the Nightosphere with me? I'm visiting with my dad and it's craaaazy boring.| Whoa, wait a minute Marceline. Last time I saw your dad,  I sliced open his soul sack. 
  Oh no, he's totally chill now.| Okay, but I'm keepin' an eye out for your old man in case he pulls any  sneak attacks.
  There you are, Marceline.  Huh?  Oh. Hello, dog. Hello, Finn. | Stay away from me, old man! 
   Look, let's play something, okay?| Okay!
"   I know you just wanna give your little girl the world, but Daddy I'm not just your little girl. I've got my own life, I've got my own plans, I hope you understand and like the way that I am because I want your respect and I want to be here. But I don't wanna rule the Nightosphere.  Psssh. Whatever, Dad. [Puts the amulet on. A suit comes out of it and wraps itself around her. The phone is dropped and tentacles are seen. The phone is picked up and Marceline is seen looking like her father's monster's form in ""It Came from the Nightosphere."" The camera zooms out to show Finn approaching Marceline while she laughs evilly."| Jake, grab the amulet! 
  Well... that explains how we got amnesia-ed.  But what about banana?| Hey man, there's another video!
  We got mad prison overcrowding down here, fellas.  So I gotta put you in the cage with the stuff. Sorry about that. But, you know, not really.  Aw, my stomach! | That amulet's controlling Marceline! We have to go back and help her!  We're gonna get back using that one portal spell we know!  Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum! 
   Whoa, dude!  She told us never to come back!| Oh yeah. Oh!  Jake! Can you turn into a gross demon?
  Mhmm. | Grosser!
   What's your disguise?|  Paper plate mask, yo!
  Nice!| Let's go! 
  Yeah, gimme abs! | I think we can charge up there and rip the amulet off her neck. 
"  Hey! What're you guys doin'?! You can't run up to the front of the line! These good people have been waiting forever! Shame on you both! Everybody, shame them!  Boo, sir! I ""boo"" what you're doing! Step back!  Back!  You will not cut the line!  Again!  You stay back here! And wait your turn like the rest of us!  Under... stand?!"| Yeah, okay, okay!
  Who are you?| Ahh! Don't kill us Marceline!
  It's us! Finn and Jake!|  Your friends, remember?
  Oh Grod!| Run!  Marceline...
  Run!  Marceline...| What are you doing?
  Just grabbing a midnight snack. | It's Marceline! That's her out there!
  I know!  Isn't it fantastic?|  No! We have to save 'er!
   Save her?| From the amulet!
  But this is what I've always wanted! My girl, following in her daddy's footsteps.| But that's not what she wants!
  That's balderdash, baby. The wearer of the amulet is filled with chaotic evil! Which is how I grew up. So... | Maybe we can get these dudes to help us! 
  These guys won't help you. They're all complacent sheeple. | Wait, that's it! We're gonna freestyle a political rap to get these guys to rise out of their systemized demon apathy.
  The system is broke, yo!| Marceline! 
  Aw, sick!|  Jake! The tree house!
  Ahhhh! I'm too freaked out to move, Finn! These demons are nibbling my legs! |  Jake! Take her! 
  No, Finn! You'll be filled with chaotic evil!| Marceline...  No one...  leaves the Nightosphere!
  You gonna do the thing again?!| Yeah, man!
  Yeah, man!| Whaaaat?
  Nice.| Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, everybody.
   Man...  Dancin' is rough!| Yeah... I'm havin' some sweat issues here! I'll go get us some snackety-juice.
  Hey, man. I'm Jake.  I'm Jake.  Hmmmm...| Check it out, Jake! I got us some peanuts. And punch! 
  Check it out, Jake! I got us some peanuts. And punch! |  Choking!! Don't give up on me, man!
  Whoa, Finn, nice book.|  Yeah. 'S pretty cool. It's the Enchiridion—the hero's handbook.  Hey, guy, you alright?  Haha. He's all good! Everybody get back to your dancin'!
  Uh, Finn? I think that bear is followin' us home.| Whoa. Haha. I think you're right. Hey, bear, you gonna come hang out with us?  Whaddaya say, bear?  Heh-heh. Awesome.
  I dunno, Finn. This guy seems kinda weird.| Yeah. He's totally weird. Hahaha! 
   Mmmmm...| Jake! Hey, Jake!  Jake!
  Jake| Come here! Ya gotta check this out!
  Eh, okay.| Check this out, man. This bear is tops blooby!  Watch this.  Ya gotta try this, Jake. He does everything I do!
   Oh, stop! | Haha, come on, Jake, try it!
  Heh-heh. Um... Yeah, okay.  Sweepy-sweepy-sweepy. Sweep sweep sweep. Sweepin'!|  He's got me down pat! Heh-hah! Sweeping's weak.
  Sweeping weak.| Whoa! This guy's alright!
  This guy just busted me up my chops, Finn!| Hey, come on, he's just a bear. He don't know nothin'.
  Mmmm... Yeah, I guess. Well, anyway, it's gettin' pretty late. Probably time for everyone to go back home to their own houses.| Yeah, I guess you're right, Jake. It is pretty late. He should probably stay here tonight.   You can sleep in the bathtub!
  Braaaathtrub. Sleep in.|  Brathtrub, hahaha! This guy's tops blooby!
   Whaaaat? Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, everybody.  Whaaaat? Hey!  Hey, Princess Bubblegum! Hey, everybody!  Whaaaat? Hey!| What are you doing?!
  Shhh. Come with me. Ya gotta see somethin'. This bear's wiggy, Finn. It's wearing your clothes and dancin' around all crazy.| That sounds rad, man.
  Aw, man!  Oh, ya gotta believe me, Finn. I swear, he was, like, all wigged-out, was dancin'... | ...I do believe you.
   Oh.| It's just, y'know, who cares? Dancing, wearing clothes... He ain't hurtin' nobody. He's just doin' it up, y'know? He's just cool, and he likes my style. That ain't a crime.
  No.  I guess not.| Okay. Great. I'm going back to bed. You comin', smart guy?
  | Anyway, I gotta go pick up BMO from soccer. I'll be back soon. And remember
  Uh, nope. The bear did it, and I've got proof. I taped the whole thing.|  The bear ate all my cakes, and you just sat there and watched him do it?! What's wrong with you?!
  Ju— What?! No, man, he was tryin' to frame me, Finn! He's tryin' to steal your identity! Why can't you grok that?!|  He's a bear, Jake! He's a wild animal! He doesn't know things! He just does stuff! He's cool!
  Ohh, fine, then that's just great. Then you and M.C. Cool Friend can go stink it up together at your stupid cool Finn party all by yourself, cause I'm not going!| ...Wait. What? What party?
  What? Your party, man. Tonight? In the woods?|"  ""Finn'z... bezt... party?"" But... I didn't make this flyer."
  See, dude? He's not just jackin' your style. He's jackin' your whole you! Jackin' yo you up!| What the what?
   Sure! I'll have another...   ...peanut.| She's not my...  We never went steady.
  Troops brooby! Troops brooby. Troops— | Not cool, man.  You're not me. You're just a bear acting like me.   It's okay, everyone. The imposter is gone.
 Finn... nobody really thought the bear was you.|  Wait... what?
  We just thought it was one of your jokey-joke-jokes. | Hey! Hey, bear!
  Wait up, guy!| Hey. I... I didn't mean to make you feel so bad about yourself. I'm really sorry about that.
  Me, too.| But... you're a super-rad bear, so... why not just be you?
   I... want... be... hero... like... yooouuuu!|  Awww...
  I guess he's got a heart of gold after all.| Hold on, bear. I got something for ya. It's the Enchiridion, the hero's handbook. Everything you need to know about being a hero is in this book. Take it, and learn.
   Finn, are you nuts?! We can't give that book away! It's, like, crazy-important!| Whatever, man. We never use it, except for, like, sitting on it when the grass is wet and stuff.  Drink your fill of knowledge. Someday, you'll be a great hero.
  The Tree of Blight.| Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land.
  Huuugs!| What the—?! Is this an extra butt?!  Quick, Jake! Burn the tree!
  Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over!| No!  Jake, hurry!
  Is he crushin' you, man?!|  No, he's just... hugging me gently!
  Hey, buddy, you okay?| Didn't even tell me its name...
  Wha..,?|  Oh, sweet! Ha-ha-ha!
  Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy?| I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps.
  Hmm...  You've got a fever, man.| I feel hot. 
  You feelin' better today?| Yeah. I feel like a million clams.
  Huh? Not again!| What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun?
  Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night.| Uh... I didn't hug you last night.
  Yes, you did! My love handles still hurt! You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze—a really strong one! | CB says I hugged 'im. Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya.  Oh, Cinnamon Bun.   What a crazy story, buddy.
  Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy.| Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you?
  I'm just sayin' you were really clingy.|   But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun.
  Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right?| ...So...?
"  Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is.  ""Hug wolves—a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon.""!"| Like last night!
  Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature.| Well, how can I get uncursed?
  Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure.| Uh... I'm scared, Jake... 
  No hugs!!| I'm sorry!  I feel hot! Rrrrr!!
  Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you.  You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??| I think so.
  I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??| Yeah. I heard you. I said I think so.
  I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout.| Oh. Okay. IS THIS GOOD?!?
  Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel?| Prickly and painful.
  Good, good, you're doin' great!| Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now?
  No, you can't hug anything.| But that poor cactus! It... it... NEEDS ME! 
  Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain!|  I want to hug you, Jake! Close!
  Finn... say something to reassure me.| I'LL HUG YOUR MOM!
  Jake! We need the silver baseball!| Hrrugs!! HUGS FOR BUDDIES! 
  Oh, Glob! Oh, my Glob, Jake! Mama!| Bring it in, guys!
  BMO! Strobe light mode! | Not cool!
  Back, beast!| Hug wolf, away!
  Surely this frosted drink will soothe my fevered tempers.  Hellooo? Good heavens! A lycanthrope! AAAAH!!|  Hug you up, bro! 
  Dracula? AAAAH!! Eeee!!|  HUUUUGS!!
  There he is!| Huh? Huh?  What... What happened? Jake... what happened to me last night?
  You hugged... everyone.| NO!
  We're mad, but we're not gonna go down there.| People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe, ...and because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon.
  Uh...| Huh?  HUUUGS!! 
  I-I-I-I'm not supposed to.| Don't you want a hug?
  I can't, man!| Not even a little one?
  Uuuuhhh...| You want a hug?
  I'm gonna hug you up.| You call that a hug?
  Yeah... You stopped, too.| I just... didn't feel like I needed any more hugs.
   Can I get a hug?|  JAKE!!!!!
 Oh, my gosh! How many times do I have to tell you? Somebody broke into my house and stole my lumps!| Peebo?
  Eeeeeugh...| Eh...okay, calm down...
  Haha, gross.| Whoa! Gals... we'll find this crazy freak and return all of your body parts!
  Thank you so much, Finn!  I should give you a kiss!| It's... it's okay, Hot Dog Princess! We'll be right back.
 Other| Ice King, we know you did it!
  Lady don't take my pizza....| What's h— Oww... 
  What's h— Oww... | A mo-mo-mons-mo.....
 Other| Hey, Ice King!
  Ouch.| Do you give up?!
  Finally... let's get those princess parts back to the ladies.| Yeah, mans. Wait... where'd your wife go?
  Yeah, mans. Wait... where'd your wife go?| Huh?
  What'ya building?| Um, it's just a little stick fort.
   Hey, get away from my fort, you big stinky monster!| I like it when you get small, Jake.
  Whoa, whoa!|  Whoa, Peppermint Butler!
  Hi, Finn. Hi, Jake.| Hi, Goliad.
   Hi, Finn.| What did you use to make her?
  I still need to fill them with knowledge...  about how to rule a kingdom. | What? Let us teach her.
  Woow, woow, woow!| C'mon, Goliad.
  C'mon, Goliad.|  See ya later, Princess! Get some sleep!
  Huh? Whu...? Bye guys...| Look, Goliad. This is a preschool. I'm gonna set up some obstacles and all that for you to learn on, is that okay? 
  Yeah, thanks Finn. I'm excited to learn.| Okay, great. Jake, you go and get some kids from inside to help with the lesson and such.
  Wow, holy shmow!| Oh, hey, y'all are just in time. You ready to pop this croc's back Dr. Goliad?
  Uh, you know, Finn... maybe this isn't such a good idea, actually.| Oh, no, it's cool. I got helmets for everybody.
  Oh, no, it's cool. I got helmets for everybody.| Okay, Goliad, you ready to lead? 
  Ready!| Okay, in 3, 2, 1...  Go!
  You're gonna mess up Goliad! I'm Don Juan Cherry Temp—  Cherry Tempo! It's my way or the highway, Glob-globbit!| Stop stop! No, Goliad, no! Leading isn't about scaring people, you gotta stay calm and use your head. Use that beautiful brain, girlfriend.
  My brain? Are you sure?| Yeah! Don't be shy. Try it on me, lead me.
   No, Goliad, that's wrong, too.| You can't just control people or whatever, it's messed up.
  No, Finn. This way is good. Everyone did what I wanted. Really fast, no mistakes, calm like you said. This is definitely is the way to lead. Definitely.| Um, no, no. ...Wait, is that true? 
  Goliad's got mind control powers!| She got the wrong idea about leadership!
  No, Princess.   This is my castle now.| Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!
   Ugh, eyeball... Just tuck that eyeball back in its hole.| Goliad, no!
  Goliad, no!|  Jake, don't swallow!
   Jake, don't swallow!| Uhh, you're in Finn's bubble.
  Uhh, you're in Finn's bubble.|  Don't think of the plan... Think of something else. Think of something else.
  Finn, are you okay?| Yeah, that dude saved me.
  That's Stormo, Goliad's new brother.| Wha-- What are they doing now?
  Wow, man, so, like... I guess they're so evenly matched that it's a stale—  It's a stale— | They're so evenly matched that it's a stalemate!
  Yes. Stormo sacrificed himself to keep Goliad in check for all eternity.| Well, that's pretty cool, but... I don't understand. If Goliad and Stormo are the same, how come Stormo is a good guy?
  Oh, that's simple| Oh, whoa so, that means Stormo is like... my son?
  Well, yeah... in a way.| Happy birthday, Stormo.
  Man... let's go home.| Nuts to that. I wanna find a mystery cave.
   But, Finn, I'm gettin' all cranky around my joke-hole.| Ow!
  Oof!| Ooh-la-la.
  Whuzzat?| Mystery cave! C'mon, Jake!  Oh, my glory...
  Dude, no!! Don't touch that thing! It's probably got some kind of sacred significance.| Yeah. I want it for my sacred bathroom.
  Finn?!  Oh, my Jah! Finn's become one with the lamb!!| Jake!! You see this crazy jazz?!
  Wish I knew how to free you, bro.| Me, too, bro.
  But Finn always loved BMO farting. | Heh heh heh heh heh!
  Okay!| What? Nooo...  No! Not this song!!
  Are you hearing this, buddy?| Guys... I haven't liked this song since I was two.  Cut it OUT! 
 Other|  It's just a dumb old leaf, ya dumb old Ice King.
 Other| Wait! What?! Ice King! You can hear me?
 Other| No, it's just no one else can see me or hear me talk.
 Other| Man... Never thought I'd be happy to talk to you, Ice King. Can ya help me get free??
 Other| Anyways... Where do all these spirits come from?
 Other| Sick.
 Other| Cool.
 Other| And doing that will set me back to normal??
 Other|  So be it!
  Alright, Finn. This oughta free you from your body prison. Couple-a' rounds of Kompy's Kastle will jog your psychic schnaps. That's what I think. Co-op mode like we always do! Oh, yeah! C'mon, Finn, drop the drawbridge. Kompy's blood lust meter's goin' down. Lemme help ya there.  Whuzza!! You love Kompy! | I... did it.  I did it. I'm ready, Ice King. Make me normal now.
 Other|  Ew! Ew! Ew!  Eeeewwww!! 
 Other| So... now I can go back to normal.
 Other| ...What?
  Wanwan!| What is that?
 Other| What do I do? Follow the heads?
 Other|  Alright, man, I'll get it.  Where's your daddy, huh? Is he hiding in there?
  Wanwan.| You better get back in the Spirit Hole, dead one.  Okay... 
   Wamwanwan.| Oh, my what? The cave?? How the...??? ...Weird. That's weird, but whatevs, though.  Whatevs. Ice King! Ice Kiiiing!  Where'd you go, Simon?  Ice King?  Dude, come on, what?
 Other|  I'm gonna re-open the hole.
 Other| Great. Now we're both stuck in here.
 Other| STOP! WUUH!
 Other| Ah, jeez, come on!
 Other| Whoa, do that again.  Your hand is affecting the TV! We must have some kinda subtle effect on the material plane!
 Other| It's okay! But let's use our subtle influence to break the lamb!
 Other| Yeah, man! Bwoooo!  It's workin', man! Combine the swirls!
  Whoa! Finn, is that you?!|  YES!!
  Finn! Finn! Finn!  Whooooaaaa...  That was beautiful!| Heh-heh.
  Oh, my Glob! Turtle Princess! I've always wanted to write trashy books for ladies!  YAH!  BACK UP OFF ME, RICKY!!  Yeah, everyone needs to know when I work these lumps, no man is immune to their influence!| Jake's ball landed over here, BMO!
  Aaah...| Heh heh heh heh heh heh!
   Ooh!| 'Sup, LSP?
  Oh, hey. I'm answering that ad you put out for the adventure secretary.| Wha?
  Ugh... Hold on. I'll get it.  Hold on. It's down in there. Okay, wait, I got it. Uh, here you go.|"  ""WANTED—ADVENTURE SECRETARY.""  Smells like fruit pie."
  It's nice of you to wanna be our secretary... but we don't need one.|  Dude, look at 'er.
   Mmm... Oh, Glob...| Yeah, it's sad. Come on. We've gotta help 'er.
  I'm gonna need a secretary desk!  I'm starving! What's for dinner?!| Oh. Uh...  We got some blueberries.
  Yuck.  Looks like I'll have to bust out these cobras to get a better dinner.  Hey, Finn...  You got anything better to eat??|  Oh, cool. Old spaghetti. I'm gonna go heat this up. 
   Chapter 1|  Have a good night. See ya in the mornin'.
  What're you guys doing?| We're carrying these rocks on an adventure, up to the Mystery Mountains.
  Oh, nuh-uh, I am not gonna carry rocks!| That's okay. Jake can carry 'em.
  Ugh... My arms weren't meant to carry so many rocks, you guys!| C'mon, LSP. You can make it.
  Would you be mad at me if I ask out Billy, that vulture who was hitting on you? I think he's cute and I would—| Hey, LSP, shake a leg.
   Can't talk right now, girl! | The Loch of Phantoms. Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the safe path. 
   This is way too boring for my book.  Oh... my shoulder strap... Oh, my orange juice is comin' out... Ha! Gotch—Huh? |" Haha! Jake! ""Ker-ploop."""
  Not... gotcha?| Alright!
  Ugh! This place is plops, Finn!| We can meetcha back at the tree house later if you want.  That weird light...
  Hey, Finn! Finn, my dress is slipping!!|  Huh? Listen, LSP, we've gotta be carefu—
  Oooh, my dress...| No, LSP! It's not safe!
  Heeeeeeey...  Oh. Hey, Fiiiiinn...| She's stuck in there!
  That was so crazy! What just happened?!| Oh. Uh, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors. Evil stuff happens when you look into them.
  Oh, Glob... I had to look because I looked so good!| LSP... you don't need a mirror to know you look good.  You're beautiful on the inside. Like... your brain and stuff!
   Yeah... A book about how I'm hot, and Finn only wants... He's so... hot.  ...Finn has the hottest lumps, but his lumps are on the inside! YAAAAGH!!  HE'S GREAT!| Uh... Bye, LSP.
  Finn! You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours!| Oh. Yeah! Yeah, I have.
  Finn... I was never really your secretary, Finn. I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps because I'm so hot, Finn!!|  Oh. Okay.
  But you're the one who's hot, Finn!!| Wow. Uh, thanks!
 Why does he want your crown anyway, Princess?|Yeah, what's his beef?
  Okay, I was thinkin' I could  dress up like a mailman.|Yeah. Yeah, and I could wear all black and I could be like, you know, like, your shadow.
 You ready?|Yeah. Let's bust it.
  Some milk?|"Psst! Get ready, Jake. When we get to the cookie, you throw some milk in his face and yell, ""Alvin's hot juice box. Alvin's hot juice box."" He'll be really confused, and that's when we grab him and tie him up-style."
 Did you hear that?|Yeah. Change of plans—I'll go take care of those chips. You keep the cookie distracted.
 Yeah. I can do that.|Okay, awesome.
 Hmm.   Looks like a false alarm, Cookie. It's just some kid's Baby Snuggleghost nightlight. Hee-yah! | Alvin's hot juice box! Alvin's hot juice— 
  We're really doing it!|Jake! What are you doing?! What happened to the plan?
 New plan—I'm gonna help Princess Cookie escape.|What? But-but he's a criminal!
 No, man, Princess Cookie's a good guy. He just got dealt a bad hand. He's only trying to be what following how his dreams make you want to be, man!|Whaaaat?
 You're either with us or against us.|Um... 'gainst?  WAAAH! Oof.
  No. It's nothin'.| There's lots of boxes that have nothing in them, but also, you can put something in the box, and then it won't be empty. Does that make you feel better?
"  Ha ha. You're a charmer, Finn Human. No... it's... well... Lady Rainicorn doesn't wanna play the game Card Wars with me. I always beat 'er... so she says, ""No more Card Warring."""| What's Card Wars?
  It's a fantasy card game that's super complicated and awesome, but—well... No, it's kinda stupid. Never mind.| How come you never talked about it before? It sounds cool!
  Really? Well... I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe.| It is, man. But I still totally wanna play it. So no more moping, okay?
  No. I do not play such games... with Jake.| What's that mean?
  Ah, whatever. Let's play the game.| So what kinda stakes do we play for?
  How about... the loser... is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy?| Those are good stakes.
  Coffee ground, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, and... this stuff. | Hey! You're ruining that pop with weird taste!
  We drink when the game is over.| Oh, gross.
  That's basically the basics! So once we have our kingdom set up...  ...it's time to start to play. FOR THE GLORY!  Hey, were you asleep?! I'll have to explain it all over again!| Doesn't matter. Let's just play.
  But if you don't know the rules then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does! And then you'll hate the game, and then you'll hate me, and then... and then...|  You think you're gonna win? I'm gonna crush you! Party-dance-style, dweeb!
  Haha! Bring it!| So... how do I get my land on the map?
  Oh... you, uh, floop your land cards.| Uh...
  Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage!| Oh!  Hmmm...
  Okay, I go first. I floop the Silo of Truth!|  Hey!!
  Pfff, you got really lame cards. Hmm. I'll take the Cerebral Bloodstorm, though.| Huh? 
  Okay, now it's the battle phase. I'm attackin' your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights.  And I'm castin' Cerebral Bloodstorm!  So, what'll you use to defend?| Uh... Can my Cool Dog and Ancient Scholar defeat your Husker Knights?
   Of course not!| Hmm. Then I floop the Pig.
  What?! | What?
  Okay... okay, first of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight. You activate a creature.| Hmm. No. It says I can floop the Pig. See?
   No... He's eating all my cornfields! My Husker Knights draw energy from corn! | And, since I'm not actually attacking, your Cerebral Bloodstorm only does damage... to your own kingdom's troops.
   You just wiped out my entire attack!!| What do you expect if all your power units come from corn? Pigs eat corn, dude. Cornfields stink.
  CORNFIELDS ARE AWESOME! What makes you think you know so much about Card Wars?!| It's just logic!
  ...Your turn.| Hmm...
  You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first.| Oh. Right.
  Look at you. You're a babe in the woods. Your beginner's luck ends this round!| Hmm. 
  Spirit Tower?! And the Cave of Solitude?!| Now my battle phase begins. I activate my Ancient Scholar... to begin studying.  And I also move my Pig to the Cave of Solitude so he can take a nap.
  That's it? You're not attacking?| I'll attack on a different turn.
  HA! Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors! I cast Field of Nightmares and activate my Legion of Earlings to scare your Pig to death!| My Pig's in the Cave of Solitude.
  Um... I cast Teleport—to move your Pig to the empty field so I can attack 'im!| Uh... wouldn't Teleport only work on your own creatures?
  You're right. I'm gonna slay that Pig, though!| How? You don't have any creatures that can touch 'im!  Face it, man. I'm the cool guy.
  Hmm.  You're the cool guy, huh? Well, lemme make it a little hot for you, then.  Heh heh heh heh... I floop the Volcano!| What?! That'll destroy your kingdom too, won't it?!
  Hmm. Maybe.| Aah!! My Pig!!
  Cornfields give the Immortal Maize Walker triple damage.| Uhh...
  I told you cornfields are awesome! Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive this time!| Actually, my Ancient Scholar's been studying the Raise the Dead ability.
 So what?|So, my Ancient Scholar raises the dead.  I floop the Pig.
  NOOOOO!| Look! My Tower's doin' a thing!
  YOU GANKED MY SPIRIT WALKER! AAAAGH!!! | Uh... Maybe we should take a break?
   Your turn.| Huh?!
  YOU PLAY! YOU PLAY! |  Oh, zing.
  I do not play such games... with Jake.| Sorry! I gotta use the boy-style room!   BMO! BMO!
  BMO chop! If this were a real attack, you'd be dead.| BMO! Jake's acting banununununus!
  Oh, no! Are you winning the game of Card Wars?| Yeah!
  That's terrible! If Jake loses the game, he gets super depressed! When I beat him, he wouldn't talk to me for a month!| What?! I only played so he wouldn't be bummed!
  Finn, you must take a dive.| Okay, I'll try. But... I'm a Card Wars super Amadeus!
  Play. The. Game.|  Grob. Better make this look good.   Alright, Jake. Prepare for my ultimo attack!
  Well... I've still got my Wandering Bald Man.  Oh, no.|  I need to get rid of my Pig so Jake can reconstitute his cornfields.   I activate the Pig—to attack your Wandering Bald Man.
  Well, that's stupid. Just attack with the Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with.| No way! You've underestimated me and my Pig all day!
  No way! You've underestimated me and my Pig all day!|  Please lose. Please lose!
   Please lose. Please lose!| Noooo!
  OHHH-HO! Ohhh, oh, yeah! Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them! Hahaha! The Pig is mine! First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape, then I cast Summon Archer Dan!|  Whoa. Math.
   Whoa. Math.| My boys!
  You have no creatures left. That's the game, boyee!! The five winds blow through cornfields once again! For the glory of Jakoria!| Heh. You got me.
   In yo' face! It's time to drink up! It looks like you are the dweeb and I'm the cool guy!   Is it... too gross for you, man?| No, no. I gotta take what's coming to me.  Hey... Not that bad! I like it!
  WHAT?!| You want a taste?
  AW, IT'S GROSS!|  In your face, dweeb!
  Wait, wait!  Shh, shh, shh! Shush!| I wasn't...
  You hear that?  It was totally silent for, like, a whole second!| Huh. Oh, yeah! Cool.
    Aah!  Ooh! Waaa-zoo! | Hey...
  Now we must return you to Mars, where vengeance awaits thee.| That's not-
  That's not-| Magic Man! Get UP!
  Did it work? Is he gone?|  Hee-yup-hoop! They took my friend to Mars! Fly me there and help me save him!
   Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't. See?  The transfer drained me. I can probably barely float.  So, I just gotta wait till they kill your friend! See ya! | What do you mean, KILL?
  They're gonna put him on trial for my crimes! Ain't nobody gonna pardon these crimes on my head. Not even the King of Mars! And once he's dead, my magic juice will return to my body. Flowing through me like moonlight through the ghost dance.| SQUEEZE!!!!
  I wish I could help. Except I don't!| You succubutt!
  C'mon, let's go to my house. C'MON, LET'S GO TO MY HOUSE!! | How long have you had this house?
  Yes, that is true!| Well, I bet there's something in here that could help me save Jake.
  There is, but you'll never make it work.| What?! Where is it?
  I don't know! Have you seen my trash palace? | Yeah, what's the deal? This place is wrecked. Eeeew, ew! What am I stepping in??
  That's where I blow my nose all day!| Ugh!
   Help me, you coward!| Magic Man, what is your deal for real?
  You tell me.| Well, for one, I think this house is a reflection of your sick brain.  Look at this. Yuk. Who's this you're standing with in this picture?
  It's downstairs.| What?
  My special thing.  Whoa! Aaaaagh!| Holy crepes.
  Aah!  Tada! C'mon.  That's the thing. My special thing.  A Martian transporter.| This can take me to Mars?!
  Yeah. My brothers gave it to me when they banished me to earth. They thought I'd learn love and use it to go back home.| How does it work?
  You put your hands on those thingies and think stuff about people.  But it's broken! Hasn't worked in 200 years.| But... It has to work. It has to.  For Jake. 
  Huzzah??| YAAAH!  WHOOOOOOAAA!!! 
  Citizens of Mars, King of Mars...  Today the most notorious fiend in Martian history stands before us—Magic Man.|  Stop! 
  Magic Man, it bums me out to see this. I remember when you were really cool, before that night you spent on Olympus Mons with Margles.|  Aw, man.  Force field.
  Space Dome, open!| Oh snap. 
  And that someone would miss you?| Yeah that's ME, you dishrags! 
  I win again, just like always!|  Jakey! No!
  The one you were prophesied to meet!| I don't care none for that mess. This wouldn't have globbed if you'd just...listened to my bro! You bunked up, King of Mars! The wisest, most honest super being of all time just put an innocent dog to deads!
    Huh? Hey, I'm alive!| Yay! King of Mars saved you!
  Yes, but at what cost?| Oh, man. Should we go get Magic Man?
  No. I lost a friend. I cannot lose my brother, as well. Hey! What? Where did he go??|  EAT MY SKIDS!  YAAAAH!
   Oh, Margles.| MAGIC MAN! 
  You fat coward! | Go! Get out of here, tiny manticore!
  Whatevs. I didn't need your pity help!| Jeez. What?
  I am the true coward. Hiding from sincere expressions like a vampire in the nude who hides from the light. Thank you, brave hero. I was freed from bottle jail, but my new prison...is shame. MY NEW PRISON IS SHAAAAME!!!| What's he saying?
   I wanna see inside!   I love it! | Great!   This doesn't hurt as bad as it used to.   Oh gob! Oh gob! Oh gob! 
   Finn!| Haha, I'm okay!
   Hmmmm...| 
  Oh!  Do the thing that I like.|  
   Now do the thing I like.|  
  Thank you for building my new home, Finn. I'm so happy.|  You... wanna hug?
  | Bye.
   Bye, Finn.|  Bye! 
  Looks like your date went pretty good buddy.| Uh... I don't know, was the hug okay? Give me some tips man.
  Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look, look , let me explain some junk about dating. Right now, , you're at Tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon,  you'll be at Tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road , you'll make it to Tier 5, where she'll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong, beautiful stomach. Then after awhile, you'll make it to Tier 8 , where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special.|   What about Tier 15?
   You stay away from that! Do not do Tier 15!|  Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about.
   Don't worry about it dude, just let things naturally move to Tier 2. Oh and um, you need a shower dude.| What?!    Oh gross.
  What?!    Oh gross.| Do you think Flame Princess could smell me?
  Probably.| Crup.
  Oh.| I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale!
  What? Why?| Just don't.  Hyap!
  Finn!| 
  I have something important to tell you. About relationships.| Ah, that's okay, Princess.
  I just hope, you'll understand.  Relationships  are like layers of sedimentary rock.......| Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me. I'm gonna bounce out.
  Uh, ok,  Tier 2 baby!| Word. 
  What's up man?| Yo, dude! So what did Princess Bubblegum want?
  She doesn't want you see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous!| 
  So, you at Tier 2 yet?|  I got about five hugs, does that count?
  Nnoope.|  Uhaah.. Well, I'm still at Tier 1.
"  Say something about her ""spectrum."""| Ee-eww! Let's see.... She's bright. She's beautiful. She makes me feel... confused, l-like something's filling up my chest, like I can't breathe, is it because she's so.. dangerous? Glob, Jake, I can't stand it! 
  Finn!| 
  Whatcha doin'?| Oh, uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uhh, writing something for Jake.
  Oh, well, speaking of Jake. Did he explain everything to you?| Yyeah.
  And you understand?|  Yeah, I understand.
  Finn, sometimes you want someone and you  want to kiss them, and be with them. But you can't, because responsibility demands sacrifice.|  What are you trying to say?!
  I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess.|  Grr... Bubblegum! I can't do this anymore!
  What?| Now you like me?!
  Finn, what are you talking about?| What am I talking about?!  PB, I was.... geh...eh..  I was in love with you! Okay?! And you didn't love me back! Now I'm ready to move on, and it's like...rrmph!! You're gonna build me up all over again! Well, I'm done! I'm done. 
  Faster!|  Your wavelengths are my weakness, your emissions are what I've been missing. 
  No!|  Ohhhh-uh, Flame Princess! 
   Ohhhh-uh, Flame Princess! | FLAME PRINCESS!
  |  Ohhh-tsst. Flame Princess!
   Geh.. What about Finn?| Hey!  What's wrong? Please, say something.  Please...  I need you...  to be okay. 
  Huh, ummm. |  Are you okay?
   She's stabilized. We're safe... for now.|  
  Haha! Take that, Master Chen!| JAAAAKE!
  What?| Jake, did you hide my sock?
  I don't do that kinda stuff anymore.| So, what? It just magically disappeared?
  Maybe.| Is that just a cute way of saying you took it?
  No!| Why don't you just help me find my sock?
 With the lipstick, she looked as beautiful as ever.|  I'm worried about BMO.
  Ya see, man? That was really fun. You don't need two socks to have fun.| Yeah, I guess. But maybe it woulda been more fun with two socks! 
  Finn, Finn! I know where your sock is!| Huh?
   It was in your pillow this whole time! See?| Whoa haha!  Right on, BMO!
  Ronnie the mouse stole it, but Lorraine chicken set him up to kill Bebe, but the flatfoot busted Ronnie, and Lorraine skedaddled with the loot, but BMO solved the case!| Yay, BMO! Yay! Yeah!
  Yay, BMO!| Yay!
 Long live the king!|What... is... goin' on? 
  Long live the king!|Huh?!?
 Wowowowowowow...|Hey... do I know you?  Hey... I know that guy!
  He doesn't know he's dreaming.|Huh?  Huh??
 Come on, honey. Eat your soup.|...Huh...? Wait, wait, wait...
  You haven't much time, sir.| What??
 And you are in danger.  You need to find this worm and break it.|Find the worm? But... you've got 'im right there! 
 Satori!|Huh? Huh? Huh?  Jake?
  Uh... okay.|The worm!   Worm... worm... Woyyym! Worm!!
 Finn! Aw, man, is it really you?| Jake?  Yeah. I think so.  Yep.
 I'm trapped in this dream, and I can't wake up!|Me, too! I was just in some other part of the dream with Princess Bubblegum and Flame Princess.
 Make-out dreams? Nice...|What?!  No, it wasn't like that!
 Hey, I won't judge.|...Lady's got two mouths...
 Mm-hmm. I don't think she's real.|Weird...  Ouch! What was that for?
 Just wanted to make sure you were real. Our dreams must be linked for some reason.|Whoa... Well... Pep-but told me we gotta find that worm that crawled through that hole and break it.   In my dream—  In my dream... suddenly, an unimaginably amazing sword appeared in front of me able to blast the hole open.  Rad!  I usually dream of messed-up stuff, like a shark tryina' bite off my face.
 Careful! If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart!|Ohhh.
 Just shrink down like me.|And then I shrunk down like Jake. 
 And then I shrunk down like Jake. |How do you know so much about dreams and stuff?
 'Cuz I sleep a lot.|Heh heh. Oh, yeah.
 Other|What??
 Other|Who?
 Help us!|Maybe he's not really... real.
 Dad, are you okay?|That scarf looks... familiar...
 Yeah...|Man! The worm is fast!
 Yeah, it's nuts! Fast as nuts.|Well, let's catch it with...  ...some big ol' legs!
 Well... that's kinda boring for me... 'cuz that's my normal power, you know?|Then you get... birds!
 Then you get... birds!|Ay ay ay ay ay!
 Remember, this is just a dream! Keep climbing!|Now what?
 Break it!|Jake, are you okay?
 Yeah. Are you?|Yeah. I'm okay.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah!|Yeah, yeah, yeah! ...Hmm.  Was that... was that mirror always like that?  I'm pretty sure this is not normal.
  Nope, it's fine.|AAH!  Jake, I think we're still dreaming!
 Nah, it's just dream residue. Forget about it.| You sure know a lot about dream stuff...  You pinched me earlier, but I never pinched you.
  Everything's normal.   Everything's norrrmaaaal....|It's still a dream. Hmmm... Huh?!
 Hey, guys!|Why're you jankin' up my dreamscape!?
  Listen, don't worry about it.| WHAT?!
 ...Life energy!|My life energy?! I use that! Aaagh!  Wait... something's wrong. I'm missing something.  Worm!!  Oh, man... I'm gonna be stuck here... forever.
 Knock it off!|Huh?
 Psst. If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart!|Hmm? Oh, yeah! Thanks, dream Jake!  GET READY TO EAT IT!
 Wowowowowowowow...|Okay, Finn... Concentrate. Deepest... gut... fears!
 Okay, Finn... Concentrate. Deepest... gut... fears!|Oh, gross!  The ocean.  Okay... Okay, that wasn't so bad.  AAAAH!! OH, GLOB! THE LICH!!
   Hey, why don't you sit down, or pass out or something?|NEVER!!!
 NEVER!!!|Bubblegum! WAAA-HOOO!
 Finn, shush! I'm having coffee with the Lich. You wouldn't understand. You're too young. |SO MUCH SCREAMING!!!
 SO MUCH SCREAMING!!!| Had enough... destabilization?
 I don't feel so good.|GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, KING WORM!!!!!!!   Is it really you... this time?
 Yeah, mans. Actual Jake.|Cool...  Pinch.
 Ow, man, come on!|I'm just checkin'! ...Just checkin'.
  Okay. I'm going to lower the screen. Tell me what you see.| Crunchy, you look like a rainbow! It's beautiful! Can you guys see that?
  Whoa!| The aura's gone!
  Except...  Crunchy's true essence manifested in the material plane!| I wanna see Peppermint Butler's aura!
   You don't wanna see that!| Yeah, we do! Right, Princess?
  No! Bunk that, I'm tired! C'mon, Finn!| Oh, yeah. Yeah, me and Jake, we gotta peace out.
  G'night!| Hey- what's goin' on in here? Yo, guys!
  Hey, Finn!| Whoa, what's that? Security cams?
  All right. Now look at monitor three. Can you see it?| Oh, yeah! That's, uh... Who is that?
  No, man! Look there, in the corner!| Who's that?
  Plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus...| WAAAAAAAAAAAAUH! Lemongrab! What the—?

  UUGH!  I can't, Princess! My arm is broken!| Dude! You didn't have to do that...
  You got nerve showing your faces here, notorious Pup Gang!| Buncha bad apples!
  Aaagh... Glob? Is that you?| No sign of Lemongrab for three days! I think it worked!
  MOOO!!! | Man, that guy's a real D-list!
  Oh, dear! His Candy Citizens!| Let's crush this mess all accordingly!
  Crazy lightbulb hardcore style!| Yeah!
  No. He's my responsibility. I have to try to help him!| Okay, that's cool, too.
  No Lemongrab.| C'mon! Let's find the Pup Gang quick!
  Wait. I have a plan. You guys go on ahead.| Okay, cool!
  Okay, cool!| What do you got, Jake?
  Just an empty room with a catcher's mitt!| ...Weird.
  NO! NO! NO MORE HELPING!  YOOOU'RE THE ONE WHO MADE ME THIS WAY! HOW CAN YOOOU HELP?! YOU WANNA UNLOAD YOUR PUNKEST BOYS ON ME?! AND TRYYY TO CHANGE MY WAYS?! YEH POISON! YEH POISON!!!  YOU NEED RECONDITIONING!  RECONDITIIIIIION!!! YEEEEOOOOOOOUUUU!!!| Whoa! 
 What'cha think?|I can make that driz, no problem.
 It's crazy far, man.|Naw, that's just a perspectal illusion. It looks far 'cause the cliff's lower.
 Eh, go for it.|Whoo! Shoot!
 Whoo! Shoot!|Almost.
 Not really.|What? Watch me, fool!  Hup. WAAAAAAH!
 What? Watch me, fool!  Hup. WAAAAAAH!|I did it! Psych.  Hey, you know what? This is cool, just having bro time for once.
 What, like, no ladies?|Or dudes, or whatevs. It's just a chore sometimes.
 Yeah, two people is mad efficient.|Whoa.
 It's a beach brawl!|Looks like they're trying to drown a barn.
 That's not a barn. That's a dude!|Holy fizzle!  What's goin' on here, tough boy?  What is that huge dude?
   Train, Train, Train, Train!|Whoa!
 The Train is gonna smack you down on his tracks! Whoop!  Your caboose is mine!  Choo-choo. Choo-choo!|Oh, my Glob.
 Ow. My legs are backwards! Oh!  Oh, you're mean! |Did you just die?
 No... the Train will chug on. My friend makes bionic legs. I'll be better than before.| I want bionic legs! Who's your friend?
 You don't want bionic legs. It ain't natchy.|I don't care about natchy.
 You guys wanna fight me?| You think we can beat him?
 Yeah way, we can't! He's the ultimate!|But if we beat him, we'll be crazy legends.
 Man, I already am a legend in other aspects of life. Third highest score in Kompy's Kastle, bro.  Third... in the Candy Kingdom.|Jake, that's your legend. This could be our legend. Brogend!
 Okay. How are we gonna beat him, then?|Train!
 He can't even walk.|No, man, train up, like, get ripped!
 Yeah, I was just kiddin'. Let's destroy that guy! |We're comin' back for you, the Farm! After we train!
  Yeah, that's cool.|We're gonna annihilate you, the Farm!
 Mm'kay.|I'm gonna do a finishing move on you! Alright! Yeah!   C'mon, Jake!
  Whoof. |Hyah! Hyah!
  Nice one.|Yes!
 Now watch my... Something Style. |Huh?
 Huh?|Jake, you're playing Kompy's Kastle?
 Huh? Whoo! Uh... yes.|Winning this battle could take our reputation to a whole new level!
 Look, I'm a full-grown dog of my own, and I need to play Kompy's Kastle every day so I can maintain my rank.|So, you don't care about fighting the Farm?
 I never really take anything seriously... 'cept Kompy's Kastle.|Hi-yah! 
 I'm gonna break every bone in your body, then heal you later with that magical goo we got from the Cyclops' eye!  AAAH! |Ouch.
   Apologize!| Never! 
 I'm gonna turn up the juice!| And I'm gonna drink it! 
 Ouch!  Ow.  Oh!  Where are ya? Huh?|
 Huh? |Apologize for not taking training seriously!
 Come out, you chicken nug! | Huh!
 Ow.|
 Apologize to Kompy's Kastle!| No. You apologize for not taking training seriously.
 Ehh, gross!|
 AAH! My eyes!  Cheap move, you butt rag!|You! You're the cheap move!
 You! You're the cheap move!|Huh? Pants!  Huh!
 Oh!|I'm really gonna wipe you now.
  Bring it on, bro! |
 OUCH! Ow! O-o-o-ow! No bities!  Grrrrr! | I'm gonna down the Farm without you.
 I'm gonna knock down the Farm just so you'll never know the taste of downing the Farm!|Yo, guess what? Guess what, homey? I put in the time. I'ma make you mine.
 Yo, guess what? Guess what, homey? I put in the time. I'ma make you mine.|Yeah, that's right. Come and get this.
   So, what? Both at the same time? I'm cool. You gonna fight this, the Farm?  Okay.|Just me. I don't need this  clown-town.
 The only way you're gonna win is if you use your cheap moves.|
 Hey.  Come on! You gotta fight the dude!|Ah! I can't see! Walk me to the light!
 Yeah, that's what you get.| Cloud looks like a car. 
 Awaken to your dream, Finn and Jake.|Whoa. Who are you?
 I am the Dream Warrior. I've summoned you to hang with me in your together dream.|Are you gonna show us a move to beat the Farm?
 First, listen. Then, wake up.|Alright.
 Another name.|"Yeah. Don't you always call sweatpants ""give-up-on-life pants,"" Jake?"
 What is going on here, Dream Warrior?|Yeah, what's this all about?
 Ow!|Whoa. That... was a good nap.
 Hey, did you dream about Dream Warrior?|Yeah. What was he trying to tell us, exactly?
 I don't know; I didn't get it. But listen, man. I'm sorry I got mad at you. Who cares about my high score at Kompy? It ain't important.|No, man. It is important. Being the third best at something is math and deserves respect. Not like I did to Kompy. Anyway, I think we both got cranky after all that training.
 Well, good thing we're rested, 'cause now we can beat this beast.|Yeah. Oh, hey! Look!
 Dudes came back to watch us fight!|A'ight. This is it. Let's use what we learned in training.
 Dream Warrior was telling us what cheap moves to use on the Farm! Headlights mean eyes!|Mud in the eyes!
 Give-up-on-life pants!| Pull down his pants like you did to moi!
 Two golden apples!|Hm. I think I know what that means.
 Well, sure. I can make a wild guess.|You ready, man?
  Put your pants on.| Okay.
   | That was awesome! Alright, alright, my turn.    
   | 
   |  Gross!   No!  Princess? You, okay?
  | Uh, we can go get 'em.
  | 
  Oh! | 
  Flambo!  For a second, I thought the princess was farting.| Flambo, we need you to cast Flame Shield on us.
  |" These candles, must be ""They."""
    They smell like an old lady's bathroom.|  Hey! Don't disrespect my lady!
   I said that as a compliment. Like, it reminds me of grandma. I love my grandma.| 
  No one comes-sss here. Not since Flame Princess  leaved  the castle. Now guesssss what we're gonna kill Flame King with?|   A conspirator with a hiss voice!
  Even worsssse, we'll use icccce.|  And a conspirator with an untied shoe.
  | 
  Whoa!| Did you hear that?
  | Jake, come on! We gotta stop those guys from killing Flame Princess's dad!
  | Dirt bags! Where'd they go?
  | 
  | 
  SNACKS!  SNACKS! SNACKS! SNACKS!| 
  And most of actual murdersss...|  You hear that? It sounds like a voice with a hiss.
  The ssserpent that isss...| Stop!
  Dude, the voice| We must follow the voice
  To die, to sleep; To sleep|  Which way is the hiss voice coming from?
  |  Which way?
   Whooaaa.|  Jake!
   I'm okay. I think I hear that hissing voice down this way!|  Whooooo!   Why didn't you catch me?
   Vent ahead.|  Jake, I wanna see. 
    Thirty-seven...  Twenty-two|  No hissing.
  ...stuff.|  Whoa, it's him!
  ...talking about?|  I heard your hiss voice!
  ....snake on your shoulder.| What?
  |  
  | I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
    Oh. Psh, actors.|  What's going with the costumes?
   I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions.|  That's brilliant!
  |  Hey conspirator!
  Hey co-conspirator!| Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king.
  You think that's one of them.| Maybe, let's keep goin'. So, what are you packin'?
    | I thinks he's starting to crack. Water? You know what is more painful, if we pour ice in his ear. That's how we'll kill the Flame King.
  | What!? No!
  | Please, we were trying to warn you about the assassins!
  Hmmmm,  Huh?  Sire! It's your daughter's scented candles.| Ahh... ahh, ah.
  Sssstay sssstill.| Sssstill?
  | Untied shoelace?  It's them!
  Sssso long, ssssuckers!| NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES!
  | NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES!
  | NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES!  We found 'em! The executioners are the real king killers!
  Release me!| Wait! So, you? You extinguished their dad?
  | And everyone is evil here?
   All evil.| Then, is Flame Princess
  She's evil.| Okay, so your daughter's evil. We've established that, but do you think if a good guy really liked her, could he, change her to good?
  Hmmmmm, well, there'd be penalties to her experience, if she acted out of alignment. But, yes, someone could change her.| 
 |You getting all bit up by mosquitoes?
 I don't know... I'm getting bit up by something.|Man, I can't believe you said this was a good swimming hole.
 I said it might be good. It's not, though.|True.
 Wanna just go?|Yeah. This place smells like green beans.
  I need your help. My people are in trouble. I'm a mudscamp.|Yeah, Woobeewoo! Of course we'll help. Why didn't you just say something before?
 I'm shy. It took me a while to work up the nerve.|Oh. Right on. You good now?
 Whoa, relax, buddy! You're talkin' to the right couple of guys.|Yeah, man! Me and Jake will bust this Mega Frog up, right up his bumble-stop. 
  Hmm.|Gettin' anything?
 Yeah, but it's hard to make out. Could just be some footprints... or an old doodie.|Word... Hey, I have an idea. We can use those lollipops to leave a trail. That way we won't get lost out here.
 Yeah, that's a great idea, man. I was just gonna throw 'em all on the ground anyway.  Whomp.  Whomp.  Whomp.  Whomp.  This way.  The thing with frogs is they got a real subtle smell. Kinda like when you open up a new thing of, um... CDRs.|Like... electric celery?
 Yeah... but subtler.  Mm-HMM! Just as I suspected.|Sweet. These'll take us right to him.  Come on, Jake! 
 Sweet. These'll take us right to him.  Come on, Jake! |Hmm. Huh. We've passed this butt tree, like, three times.
 Oh, yeah.|We should probably backtrack--get reoriented and all that.
 Word.  Wait, these prints are all messed up!|Whoa. Yeah! Guess we better follow the lollipops back. Where's those at?
  We ran out of those a while ago.|Snaaaap. Totally lost. Dang! Do you think maybe the Mega Frog made all those footprints on purpose? So we'd use up all our lollies and get totally lost?
 What? Nah, man! Frogs are mighty dumb, you know that. He's probably runnin' around like that 'cause he's lost!  Plus, we're not even lost. I just gotta stretch up past these trees and see where we're at.  Dang. It's all misty! It's kinda nice up here, though.  AAAAAAAAH! Man, forget that! I can't see anything through that mist. Plus, I got struck by lightning. We're just gonna have to set up camp and wait out the storm.|Cool! I call fire patrol!
 Do you remember how to make a fire with sticks?|Yeah, man--it's easy.  Uhhh, rub 'em together, right?
 I don't think it's workin', man.|I think I saw some guy do it like this once. 
 That's not it. I think you're on to something, though.|Yeah, here we go! 
 |Friction! 
  Come on, boys, come on!| Mwah!  I don't know.
  You just gotta get some momentum going.  AAAAAAH! Glob-globbing stick! Glob-globbing swamp!  AAAAAAAAAAAAH!  Oh, hey, you got the fire goin'. Right on!|Jake, how did you--?  What the--? It's the Mega Frog! Quick, put the fire out!
 Jake, how did you--?  What the--? It's the Mega Frog! Quick, put the fire out!|Jake, look!  He's just sittin' there! What's he doin' out there?
 I don't know, but let's pound him while he's vulnerable.|Okay, Sweetles.  What?
  Whoaa! | Hoi-YAAAH!
  Hoi-YAAAH!|Wha--?  Jake, wake up. Look!
 Ow, my head hurts.| Look at that thing!
 Oh, what?!  Yeah, . Hey, whoa! That gives me a great idea. We can make a Finn and Jake out of sticks and stuff and lure the Mega Frog out here, then ba-donk him right while he's all confused!|Yeaaaah! That's a great idea, man!  That's a great idea, Jake.
  Fuh-fuh-fuh... fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh... |What? What is it, Jake?
 FUH-FUH-FUH-FROOOOOOG!!|Wha--?  AAAAAAAAAAAAHH!  Jake!  RUN!  Jake, stretch us outta here!  Come on, Jake!
 Wha--?  AAAAAAAAAAAAHH!  Jake!  RUN!  Jake, stretch us outta here!  Come on, Jake!|Jake, let's hide in this cave.  Shmow-tow, dude! That guy's gonna dingle our bones into tapioca pudding!
 Aaaah! He's eating me! Aah! Gently eating me! No teeth! Mostly tongue!| Hmm? Hmmm... 
 ...it's hard to make out.|Hmmm. That's it!  Jake, wait!
  Oof! Sick, dude!  Huh?| I know how to stop him!  Mwah! 
 Ah, this is rad! I'm hot again! Thanks, little dudes!  I really appreciate it!|
 I don't get it, though... I kissed just about everything I could get my lips on. How come it only worked with you?|You can't break your own curse by kissin' somebody. Somebody's gotta kiss you.
 Oh. Weird. Well, thanks, man. I don't know a lot of dudes who'd do that to help a guy out.|Whatevs.
  Hm-huh? Hmm? Oh, yeah...  thanks...|Come on, you guys! Get off me, now.  Wah! Wah! Grah!
  Wah! Wah! Grah!|Jake?
 Huh?  Hey!  Now shoo, ya little creeps!  Oh... this is unusual.| Glip... driggle!
  Eh... What's with these super penguins?| I don't know! I'm guessing it's the Ice King.
  Well, where is he, then?|ICE KIIIIING! 
  Nice ice!|What's goin' on here, man? Call off your super bros.
  Well, that's great.|Where's the Ice King, Gunther?  Gunther?! What? Alright.  Whoa!
 WHAAAA!|Is this happening everywhere?
 I don't know—lemme see.  Whoop!  Dang!|What do ya see?
 Hold on.  Oh no! NO!|What, dude?!
  Hold on, man. Wait. Oh, Glob! This can't be happening!| Tell me!
 Eh, it's over. We've been conquered.|Who's been conquered?
 Everyone.| By the Ice King?
 No, dude! By Gunther.|Holy shmow! Gimme that!  Gunther's heading for the Candy Kingdom! We gotta save them! 
  Whoa, okay. |Hurry, Jake! Wait—I'm still in my pajayjays.
 Yo, Finn, are you seeing these penguins?|Yeah, it's Gunther! He's taking over the whole thing!
 What did he say?|He says your plan is bunk.
 Well, what's your plan?|I got a plan.
 You do?|When we get there, I'll do my plan in addition to your plan. Two plans. Laters.
 Uh, alright, so you're not gonna tell me your—| I'm outies!
 You're not gonna tell her the plan?|No, I gotta be mysterious.
 What? I thought you weren't into Bubblegum anymore.|I'm not. But this is how I act now with all the ladies, you see? I keep 'em in a state of confusion. That way, I've always got options in case Flame Princess doesn't work out.
 OH MY GOSH! Where is this coming from?!|"It's called ""future farming."" I read it in that book you have by Jay T. Doggzone."
 Jay T. Dogg—awww, dude! Don't read that book! It's gonna mess up your brain. I keep that book around for laughs. It's all really bad advice.|Oh, okay. I'll stop it, then.
 No, well... you can still be mysterious—that's fine.|What? Now I'm confused.
  Never mind—I didn't say nothin'.|Hey P-Bubs! Are you ready?
 Yes. The calvary  is standing by.|Cool. I'm gonna rally some citizens and do this other plan.
 Okay, but what—?| Good luck!
 But what'll happen when they run out of bottles?|I won't let that happen, Prubbs.
  We-e-e-e-e-enk...|Stay back! 
 Wait a minute!  Put away your weapons and we'll get you more bottles.|Peeb! There aren't any bottles left!
 Yup.|What, like, forever?
 Yes.|Bubb, your plan... bunks.
  What? What do you want? I don't—|He wants to smash the Gumball Guardian's head!
 Uh, dude? Where have you been?|Yeah, and why are you all jacked up?
  Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro.| Ice King, you make our job too easy. You ready to roll on this fool?
  Ice King!| ...Wha?
  Oh... You got 'im.| Nice job, Marceline.
  It's alright. We're working on a song together. | You don't want us to...  ...for you?
  No, it's okay. You guys can go.| ...Okay... Well... I guess we'll see ya, then...
  What is goin' on in there?!|  ...I have no idea.
  You alright, buddy? Another nightmare?| Yeah. That dang snail again, man... Muckin' it up again. But... there were other guys this time, too. The bear was there, and some dogs, and Billy's lady, and Billy... and Billy was real scared of somethin' fierce, man. Somethin' real fierce! ...And the Cosmic Owl was there, too—kinda—screechin' it up.
  Whoa, the Cosmic Owl? What if that was a premonition dream, Finn?| You think?
  Could be... We better go tell Billy about it just in case. He'll know what to do.| Dang... Whoa...
  Come on! We better hurry!| Hello?  Billy?? 
  Huh!? WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GUYS DOIN IN MY CRACK?! It's THREE O' CLOCK IN THE MORNING!| Oh, you know, just drop by to say hello... See what you been uhhhhhh  up to? What Uhhhh...How are these days?
  What? Why would I be dead?!| Hehehehe... Yeah..... Stupid.... Um....? I had a dream about a bear, and an old lady, and a snail, and you were there, and the snail killed you... or something...
  Was the Cosmic Owl there?| Uhhh... Yeah! On TV! Does that count?
  Finn?| Yeah?
  Are you ready to come with me on a mission to save all life from the Lich?| Yes.
   Cool!| Why do we have to snatch them? Can't we just ask them for 'em?
  No time. The fate of the world hangs in the balance.| Oh yeah... I forgot.
  You sure that's a gem?| I think so...
  I think so...|  So deep...
  Hmm...| I want candy!  You got anything in the saddlebag?
  GET OUT OF THERE!| The Enchiridion? How'd ya get this?!
  I found it in the mouth of a bear.| A bear?
  This book is REALLY important It has magical powers. Turn the little sword sideways.| WHOA!
  Exhibio Carnotum! | Whoa!

  Oh, yeah.| Whaaaat?!?! He's gone!
  Oh! Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean nothin' by it! I mean, I have a lot of nasty friends. My uncle is nasty. I'm basically honorary nasty.|  Do you know where he went? We have to find our friend.
  Who knows?|  Uh. Oh.
  Actually, it depends on the wish I granted him.|" ""Wish""? "
  Yeah, he wished for the extinction of all life and I did it. I guess it changed his timeline or something?| WHAT?!?! OH GLOB!
  I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc—|  Whoa! Wait, Jake. Don't mess this up. Think about it
  Oh yeah. Jazz.| Hmmmm. 
  Hmmmm.| I got it! I wish... the Lich... never... even ever existed!
  I warned you, dingle.| I can hear the crown's promise of power. Invading my brain!  . Destiny Gang!  Yay!

  Whoa. Alternate-wish-world-Finn is mad uglies!  Hey, I'm mad uglies too!|

  I put out there fire... but I... also made the bomb go off. Urgh! The crown it compels me to- ice up everything!|  Urghah! I'm sorry mom, dad, little sibling.  . I'm too dangerous... to be around.

  I warned you... you butt...| Raah!

  We're three nice dudes, havin' fun! We got warm bubble water, on our buns! I love this spa, and that's a fact! But if I stay too long, I get a pruny back! | Jake... Jake, what are you doing?
  | Back off my crown, Jake! I warn you!
   Ah ha ha ha ha!| 
   It worked!| Jake! This is serious! Something really messed up is happening!
   Okay, so- scooch! Okay so I’m still pretty sure this old book is some warlock spell book or something .|  Messed.
  Warlocks, dude!  You ready for some ancient feel good spell craft?| Yeah, I’ll try it. Could always stand to feel better.

  No, I don’t.| Hey check out that gross toad! 
   Why so glum fellas?|  We stuck or thumbs in almost every hole today.

   Well sit on my needles and the shock will boost you high up into the air!  Sit on me, its okedo-its fine, go ahead.| I don't think that kinda thing really works, actually.
  You can do it if you believe in yourself! Sit on me.|  No.

  Oh I apologize for staring,  but I've never seen a chipmunk as big as you|  I'm not a chipmunk! I'm a human boy! I'm trying to climb the tree, I'm trying to get my disc back. But for now I'm takin' a break, because I am pooooped!
  You should eat an apple to reinvigorate your climbing ability. | No thanks, I'm good, just gonna rest my meat hooks. 
    Aw, that apple was cursed or something. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Oh, dear I ruined your day and now you'll never get your disc.|Naw, it's okay. I've been in worse situations. And even though I'm tiny, I do feel invigorated.
  Oh, good! What a relief!  Best of luck to you! | Bye! Bye!  Choo Choo!  Ya can't stop the train! Tree!   Woof. 
   Wohoah! You're tiny!| I ate a magic apple by mistake.
  Uhh! No wonder it's been takin' so long! Need any help?| Nah, I got it.
  Okay, well, I'm gonna walk Lady home. I'll be back later. Don't eat any more magic apples. Silly.| Yeah. No I won't.  I don't plan to.
 No, no, let's get you back.|  Blegh! DISC!   
   Blegh! DISC!   |  Woooo!  Where's my dingus? 
   Woooo!  Where's my dingus? |  Hey! Hey, buddy! Hey, have you seen  my disc! Hey, I'm over here! Hey!
  |  Hey! I'm over here! Have you seen my disc?
  Wrap it up good so I don't trip and fall on my face like the last time.| Heeey!  Musta could not heard me.  Doing, doing, doing.  Hey squirrel! 
   I think we all agree, the human must be stopped! |  Woah!
  Hey, yeah! We could put like a rug over it!|   My disc!  Uuuh, It's okay, III'm a chipmunk.
   Yaaaaaaaa! |   Huh? 
  What?| Uuuh, I didn't say anything.   What are they gonna do to me?
  What?|  What are they gonna do-
  I'm not allowed to talk to you.   Anyone and anything that winds up in the tree becomes part of the tree forever and ever. In the tree, part of the tree.| So does that mean I'm a prisoner forever?
  Well yes. And no. Are you a prisoner? Yes. Will you ever be free? No. In the tree, part of the tree. It's very simple.| Doesn't that mean that you can't leave the tree either?
  No I- Well yes and no. Am I allowed to leave the tree? No. Have I already left the tree? Am I miles away from the tree right now flying around like the flying squirrel that I am? Yes! In my mind! In- my- mind! |  Do you like it here?
"  Yeah!  Well, yes and no. Do I like the nuts and acorns? Yes. Do I like it when they put me down and say mean things like ""You're not a flying squirrel, you're just a regular squirrel! Nyaah!""? No. Do I wanna fly away from this place now? Yes. Would I make a break for it if I had a buddy to break out with? Yes."| Hey buddy.
  What?| Let's get outta here.  I got it!
  What are you doing regular, nonflying squirrel? Put that back!   How dare you!  Well alright! Everybody after those…two!|  Okay! I'm gonna throw the disc alongside the branch the we'll jump on it and fly away!
  Yeah!| Perfect! Throw!  Sooo, It's a- It's a good thing you're a flying squirrel. Huh.
  Well yes and no. |   Peace ooooout!  Okay! Activate your squirrel flaps!
  Oh! No- | Hey! We're flying! 
  Oohoho-Oh yeah! | Wooo!  Hey look! There's Jake!  Jake! 
  Is that gonna do it?  Get the C-listers out.  Good party. Oh, flip!  Look who’s hittin’ it off with the Ice King! | Hey, Jake, do you think you should date someone just like you or someone who’s like your opposite?
"  I don’t know. I’m the ""first come first serve"" kinda guy. Get in line, ladies! This Rainicorn thing can’t last forever!   I didn’t mean that. Don’t spread that around."| So it’s not good to weigh someone’s qualities against your own?
  Well, no. I mean, if you feel something, you feel something!  It’s not about personality matrixals and charts, it’s all about the bu-bumps in your heart!  You can’t stop the pumps and bumps! Pumps and bumps! Pumps and bumps! | Alright, well, what about BMO and Ice King?
  What about them? | Would they make a good couple?
  Whoa! Wait! Did BMO say something to you?| No no!
  Oh, I see. You’re being weird.| It’s not that weird! Come on!
  BMO and Ice King?| Yeah!
  You’re creepin’ me out. | I’m just thinkin’ out loud.  What, can’t think out loud?
  Oh, is that what you’re doing?| Yeah man! Pffft, jeez don’t be judgy.
  I’m not!| Yeah, you are!
  How could you know that?| I can hear it in your tone.
  You can? | Yeah, wise-guy.
   Hey, what’s that in your pants?|  What?! Not again!  Oh. I don’t know.  Whoa, look.
  Crazy.  Careful, dude.| What the--? 
  What the heck?! Are they alive?! | Hey, are you guys alive?  I don’t know, man, I think they’re some kind of magic toy.
  Maybe it’s black magic. Maybe we shouldn’t mess with them.| No, man, look! That’s you!  You’re totally shedding on the viola.
  Yeah, that’s good. How many more thingies are in there?|  Dude. Like a lot. Come on! Let’s check this out at the house. 
  I’ll make a special spagot  with a new sauce.| Sheesh. So many. PB, you hang out with Lady.  C-listers, go back in the bag. 
   Who’s in the C-list? | Tiffany, Donny.  Well, he’s okay.  Xergiok... a bunch o' these guys!
  That’s not very nice. | Don’t worry, man. They’ll get involved eventually.
  Involved with what? | I don’t know. Involved. Check out Lady and Princess Bubblegum!
   What are they talkin’ about?| It’s hard to say, but I think it’s got something to do with Lady being preggos .
  Whoa! What kinda narrative are you trying to create here?!| That’s your narrative, buddy.
  Alright, well, what else ya got goin’ on?| Hmm. Not much really. I got Ice King over here. 
  Ice King? He’s not C-list?|  Yeah, well, I saw his drum kit in here. Here we go.  Okay, jam out, little Ice King. 
   No. Don’t play with that hack. Aww, man. Hmm.  They’ve got good chemistry. Who’d have guessed?| Chemistry...
  Hey, Finn, eat the food before it gets cold.  I made a new sauce! Umm, earth to Finn, are you okay?| Yeees.
  Yeees.| Whoooooa.
   You’re up early.| I didn’t sleep. 
   You stay up all night readin’ trash books?  I told you, man. Those datin’ books.  That stuff is mess you up. | I’m not reading. I’m playing with the little wees.
  Oh, let me see little me.  Me look so lonely. Hey, Finn, pass me little Lady.| Uh, you guys broke up.
   Wha?| She’s with someone else now.
   Who?!| He’s a cool guy, don’t worry about it.
   Ahhhhhh!  What the ball, man?!|  What?
  What? What do ya think “what”?!| Come on, they’re not real, they’re like toys. These guys here, they’re goin’ out.  Pretty serious. And look at Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl. They’re still testing the waters.  But I think things are gonna work out. Check out Xergiok and Turtle P.  Weird. But cool. Right, Jake?
   I don’t like where you’re going with this. It ain’t wholesome. I’m gonna go to Lady’s for a few days. To clear my head. | Okay. Whatever whatevs.  Weird.  Huh?
  I’m back! I got over all that messed up stuff you did.  Yeesh. You okay, man?| I don’t know.
  What’s little Finn doing?| He’s... thinking.
   He looks sad. What’s he thinking about?| I don’t know. Probably lots of stuff.
  Where’s little Rainicorn?| Probably still crying.
  Wha?| She’s not handling the break-up very well.
   Aww.| PB's good, though.  After little Finn dumped her, she started working out. Looks like she’s really into it.
  This is messed up, dude. You’ve crossed the line from weird curiosity to some dark messed up stuff.|  I know!
   The destruction!  The depravity!  The wrongness of it all! I’m taking that bag back to the cliff where we found it. | No, man! I gotta fix this mess! Look at me, man! I’m staring into the shadow of my darkest mind hole! I gotta help him!
  You can’t! Just let them do their own biz, man!| I junked them up too hard though! I gotta step in!
  How would ya do that?|  I’m gonna talk to him.
  But he can’t hear you.| Yeah, why is that?
  Hmm. Maybe we’re on different dimensional planes and the border between our planes is like a two way mirror. So we can see him, but he can’t see us.|  Lemme try this. Finn! Can you hear me?  We’re connected! FINN!
  Try shakin’ him.| Why?
  Maybe we’re vibrating on different intervals. Try shakin’ him at different speeds and see if he responds.|  Okay. Fiiiiiiinn! Fiiiiiiiiiinn!
  Now go faster!| FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN!
  Faster!|  FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN! 
  Go slower, he saw you!| Okay.  Fiiiinn. Can you hear me?
  Whoa! Neat!| I made you do those crummy things. I’m why yous guys is fighting. I’m the big you. I came to apologize. I will never interfere with your lives again.  Don’t worry I will take care of it.  Sorry, my arm got tired.  Never mind. It’ll be fine. Goodbye, little Finn! I’m not coming back!
  Now what?|  Hey, ladies! This is big Finn! I caused all the problems! It wasn’t anyone’s fault! Don’t be mad at each other! Have a… dance party! Okay, goodbye! I’m not coming back! 
  Puppies! Puppies! Puppies!|  Hey Jake! Hey Lady! We came to see your new pups!
  Charlie,  T.V.,  Viola,  Kim Kil Whan, and this sweet little lady is Jake Jr.!|  Aww! Oh! That's a butt.  Preeeeetty cute!
   Yeah, Finn. I love all my little babies so much.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to them!|  Dude! Real talk! Are you worried about bein' a dad?
  It's Mom's manual for raising beautiful children.| Oh dude, Mom! She'd have been so proud to see you and your pups. 
  Aw, BMO! When was the last time you washed your controller?  WHOA! |  We were just wrestling! Cool uncle wrestling.
  Um, ah, I-I think it's gettin' kinda late. Um, puppies need sleep.| Okay. 
   Uhhh, Finn, you should go home. I'm gonna live with Lady and the pups from now on. I'm a dad now. It's a pretty big whoop. | Oh. 
   Who wants to play video games?| Yeah, okay.  I guess we'll take off.
  We'll hang out soon.| Ah, no prob, Bob. Huh, congrats again. 
  Hey guys. I'm back. |  Is everything okay?
  Nah, nah, it's cool. It turns out the pups can pretty much take care of themselves. They don't really need me around.| Oh.
  Yeah. I guess rainicorns age really fast. They're basically like older than me already. Kil Whan has a beard now!| Oh!
   I'm here just in time! |  ♪Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......♪
   Don't let the dragon, drag on, man.|  Mhm.
   Mhm.|  Thanks!
  Sign my rock.|  Okay.
   FINN!  HAVE DINNER WITH ME! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! FINN! | Sure, man. Yeah. Sure, sometime.
   How about... EVERY NIGHT! THIS WEEK!| Well, maybe one night.
   BOOM!| Hey, y'all! Don't fight!
   HAVE DINNER WITH ME! HAVE DINNER! I WANT DINNER! FINN!| Sucks!
   Finn, can't go outside today?| I guess I could. I just don't wanna deal with those guys right now.
  Ooooohhhhhh.... Deal with me!  Let's play,  Cops and Robbers!  Give me your bank account! Bang! Bang!  Reach for the roof and give me all your gold bricks.|  Ah, okay, okay, don't hurt me!
  Don't worry, Finn.  It's only me, BMO! I'm wearing  a disguise!|  Hmm....
   Your beauty's destroyed!| Hot job! BMO, how do I look?
  Whoa! Intruder! Finn! There's an intruder in here!| No!  It's me! It's Finn!  This is my alter-ego.... Davey Johnson!
  Ohhhhhh.| I'll dress up like this so no one bothers me about being Finn.
  Do you think that'll goin' to do the trick?| I dunno! 
   That's cool. Goodnight, Finn.|  I'm Davey.
  But you love being Davey.| I do love being Davey, but being Davey caused Jake to get arrested.
  But remember that time when Davey sat in the park and saw some people walking around?| Yeah, that was nice.
  And remember that time when Davey swept the floors?|  Yeah, that was great, too. But-
  Do you really wanna go back to being a famous hero? Why not just be Davey? A simple man... with simple goals and simple problems. You can just blend in and live the simple life.| Yeah.... Blend in. Y'know, maybe I'll be Davey just one more time! 
  Davey?!| No, it's me,  Finn!
   Here's your meal, criminal. We feed our criminals.  Hey, stop!|  Goodbye, Davey.
  Yeah, there goes Davey and the criminal.| Good luck catching those guys!
   Glad to have you back, buddy.| Word.
 Other|  This is the spot? Right here?  What was that?!
  Write in me!| What the—This is very strange.
 Other|  Who in this world is sadder than the Ice King?
 Hey Finn! Hey Jake! Can you come up here? I have a job for you!|Okay!
  Sorry CB, we'll finish this up later.| Hey, Preebs.
 Hey, guys. I got a letter from the earls of Lemongrab. They've gone through all the food that I've sent them.  This case contains precious candy seeds for the Lemongrabs to grow new food.  So, I need you two to deliver these seeds to Lemon Castle. |For sure. We'll do it.
 Hey, Lemongrabs! You home?|Holy--!
 Holy--!| Jake? Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
  Kiss it!|Aah! Sorry, dudes--got no food! No... food!  Hey!
 You are un-lemon.|Yeah. Cool, man. Hey, do you know where--?
 I am Lemonjon. I see you made it past our Lemon mmmmmmmeringerie!|Wait, what?
 They're quite hungry.|Yeah. What the heck's going on here?
 There is no food, only Lemons--Lemons with bellies empty but for lemon lusts!|Whatever, Lemonjon. We've gotta give those dumb-butts these seeds.
 I wonder who put them in there.|I don't know, but we gotta bust them out! Which way to the dungeon, Lemonjon?
 Oh, cool!| Thanks, man!
 Hmmm.| Yo, Lemon-wipes!
 Um, maybe we should hands... for safety.| Yeah, sure!
 So, where'd you want to look ne-- Eeeh!  Uh, Finn?!| Oh, sorry dude.
  Oh, sorry dude.| Stay close to me.
  I think this is it.| All locked up!  There they are! Hey, Lemongrabs, we're here! We're gonna get you out, just hold tight!
 Maybe the kidnapper's in there, too, coercing them.|Probably the grossest one of all, too--beet red skin, barf, poopin' all its junk-sculpture.
 Ah, stop, man! You're just makin' it worse!  Let's just get this over with. |Lemongrabs, you're free!
  NO CRUMBS!|Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves?
 Mm! Yes, yes! For the candy food was not consumed--no, no--but was given life!|Wha--?
  Who cares anyway? They've brought no food! We're all going to die!|Look. We brought these seeds.  They're special candy seeds.
 You really are gonna die.|...and all your boys, too!
 Our... boys?|Come on. We'll take you to see Princess Bubblegum. She knows more about candy than anyone; she built a whole kingdom out of candy!
 Go! Go!|What's going on, Lemongrabs?!
 We warned you about us!|Yaaaah!  What the--?
  Whoaaaaaa!|Jake! Are you alright?
 Yeah, but look!  He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom!| And he's too big to duke it out with! Unless...
 Giant poison candy aspirin!  I've got this one, but it might be too small.|No. We'll kick him in his heart 'til he's history. Those must have been Lemonjon's guts we saw before. His heart is his weak spot.
 Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time... unless that's it there  with the juice coming out. Remember all that juice, from before?|Oh yeah, that's probably it.  Whoaaa!  Oh, man!
  Tastes like vitamins.|
 Are you sure this is it? It's not even doing anything.|Just smash it already, grandma.
 Right. | Oh, nice one, Jake.
  Whoa, hold the phone! What is this powerful new juice coursing fromst my core source?  The juice aches. Is this the rumored ache of feeling? The feeling of caring unknown to Lemons? New thoughts emerge! If I act, the Candy People will suffer. If I don't, the Lemon people will suffer. The greater good demands but one course only|Whoa, dang!  That Lemonjon turned himself all up into lemon candy! Man, that Lemonjon's all right.
  ...and... there... we... go.  All done! The last trace of the candy life formula is out of their heads!|...and I snatched this  out of the Lemon castle, boyee!
 I think the swimming hole's right around the corner!|Yes! Woo! Woo!
 First one in the water is...um...first one in the water!|No fair! I have to take off my stuff.
 You ready to get out?|Yeah, dude.
 Hopefully BMO sees that.|Didn't Lady tell you not to use the Sassage Flare?
 Yeah.|Well, don't abuse it man. 'Cause you're gettin'...
 I'm gettin' what?|'Cause you're gettin' fat.
 'Cause you're gettin' fat.|Wah!  Whoa...
 Wah!  Whoa...| Hey. Relax.
 Grob, dude! You're hat's alive!  This is crazy!  He likes me!|It's not my hat. It's, like, this other thing now.
 Yeah, man, hats can be anything|Yeah, but it's like, living now.
 Yeah, it's a miracle. Now he can listen to our rad jokes and hang out.|Right. Maybe it's good he's alive.  You were a rad hat, and now you're a rad...little dude.
 Right. Maybe it's good he's alive.  You were a rad hat, and now you're a rad...little dude.|Yo, bro! Our eyes are down here. C'mon little dude. Let's go live life!
 Ha ha! You know it!|BMO, this is Little Dude.
 Hello!|Cribes!
 Oh no! Get off of me!|Little Dude, no!  You don't jump on heads. That junk is rude, Little Dude! You okay, BMO?
 I am fine, Finn. I just thought you kept better company.|Sorry, BMO, he's just excited.
 Sorry, BMO, he's just excited.|Sorry, Little Dude, but I have to eat. 
 Don't touch anything! I'm still frying up garnish!|Okay.
  Your head looks weird with short hair man, heh, heh, it feels like a peach.|Hey, Little Dude, y'all can get in on this if you promise to be good.  Only good babies get sassages.
 Hey, don't eat the—the food?|  Dude, he turned it into poo! This is poo now—smell it!
  Quit it!  Gotcha!|Oh, little Deezy. What am I gonna do with you?
 You guys should get ready for bed.|Yeah, okay.
 Yeah, okay.|Oh!
  Nyang! Nyang!|Shhhh. Little Dude, you gotta chill.  Night-night. 
  Nyang.|Jake, wake up. Someone's on the house!
 He-ah-ha. |Ugh.  No, no, no!
 Ugh.  No, no, no!| No, not on my head! Poo buns! Poo buns on my head! WAAAAAH!
 | Ninja.
  Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!|What are you doing in our house, homey?
 Please don't hurt me! You're in grave danger and it's all my fault!|Wha? What are you talking about?
 Your hat accidentally touched my head flower. See?  My magic imbues anything it touches with an evil spirit, one that craves destruction and chaos. Yech.  I buried myself so that nothing would touch my body ever again, but then this bloom grew out of my head. C'est la vie!|Evil magic donks, homey.
" I'm sorry, that's just the way my magic works.  Papa always said I was a bad wizard. Right, Papa?! ""Baby's a bad wizard."" A bad wizard, huh?! You're a bad wizard!  I'm a bad wizard! "|Whoa, cool it, man. Let's just fix Little Dude.
  Where is he?!| Little Dude! Little Dude!
  Nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang!|No, Little Dude!
 Nyang?|That's a bad Little Dude!
  Nyang, nyang, nyang... |Little Dude! You were supposed to be my buddy!
 Oh, gleeble snoots!|How is he so strong?
 Nyang?   Nyang.|No! Not the Gumball Guardian!
 Huh?  Yes! | Poor Little Dude. He was just doin' it up the only way he knew how. It's not his fault he was created evil.
 Yeah. He deserves to come back good.|Wizard, Mommy-magic this dude back to life.
 I see.|And this dude  is your pops.
 No, I-I, ooh—I guess I am. Huh.| Be good to this dude.
 I will. Way better than my papa was to me.|Yup, that's the idea. Jake, looks like I need a new hat.
  Ooh!| What was that?
"  He was saying ""evil, evil, evil"" over and over again."| Yeah, I heard.
  Well, I wasn't sure if you heard him 'cause he was whispering.| Yeah, I heard. 
  Oh, not you, Jake, my dad. I always catch him whispering stuff in my ear while I'm not paying attention. He keeps saying I'm evil.| Whoa, you best not be believing that whack bunk. I bet he's trying to make your life bad, so you'll think you're evil. But you're really not!
  How can I know for sure?| Dungeons.
  What?| Let's have a good time in a dungeon or something, that always clears my head that reminds me what's what.
  And that will make me good?| No, that will show you not to worry so much, because you're already good in here.
  Ok, yeah, let's do it.| Dungeons!
  Is this how you look for a dungeon?| Yeah... a lot of times the entrances are hidden, so you gotta look under rocks and stuff for a secret switch.
  Yeah... a lot of times the entrances are hidden, so you gotta look under rocks and stuff for a secret switch.| Sometimes it takes a while... Hmm.
  That tree over there is not made of wood.| Really?
  Really?| Yes!
  Yes!| Ooh... gauntlet.
  Thanks for taking me out Finn.| No prob, Bob, light this for me, will ya? 
  Oh, sure. Um... do we need a torch? I'm sort of made of fire.| Oh...well, I guess torches are just cool for dungeons, you know?
  Oh, okay.| Yeah...I like to hang on to it.
  Boy, this place is creepy!| Really? I feel like it's trying too hard. Gold piece! 
  Oh, you mean, like, with all the skulls? | Whoa! Whoa!
  Burning you alive!| Haha no, no, wait a sec. Sorry, one second.
  Sure.| He might have an important loot on him, so we don't wanna just burn him up; plus it's a little cruel even for an evil guy, check this out.  RRRAAA, you're gonna surrender!
  Okay, okay, I surrender!!!| I shall grant thee clemency! If you do the splits! Do the splits!
  I-I can't-I can't do the splits.| Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!
  Okay, okay...Ow, ow, ow! | See, a lot of times you can overpower these guys with confidence.
  Neat!| Got any loot on ya?
  Just this map. It'll-it'll help you.| Ha! See? This would've been burned!
  Yeah, no, that makes sense.| What else you got?!
  Yeah! Uh, uh, there's a treasure chest in the corner, please stop yelling.| Hah, hah! I knew it.  Oh, cram it to the butternuts, it's locked!
  Aahh! I don't know were the keys is, please don't yell!| Hahaha, alright. We can come back to that later.  Hey, are you having fun?
   Race you to the next monster!| WHOA, whoa!
  What?|  That's not how you do things in a dungeon. You gotta sneak.
  Sneak?| Like this.  And you gotta look around.  
  Like this.  And you gotta look around.  |  Ok, this guy's too big to intimidate, but I have a plan. First, you shoot some fire at that rope, the chandelier falls, we distract the monster and we run in. Element surprise.
   Wow.| You ready?
  Yeah.|  Before we go in, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire?
  Uhh... what?| Like on a scale of 1 to 100, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire at a rope 50 feet away?
  Uhh...| Scale of 1 to 100.
   42.|  42?!
   Well, I don't know! I've never rated myself before.|  Well, that's cool, that's cool. Just try to hit that rope.
  Are you okay?| Yeah, I'm good. it's a hologram.
  Oh. Neat. So, uhh, should we keep going?| Yeah, although it does raise the question. Why would someone go through the trouble of setting up a hologram? Unless... they've hidden something in this room? 
  Yeah, although it does raise the question. Why would someone go through the trouble of setting up a hologram? Unless... they've hidden something in this room? |  Hey, wake up.
  I was meditating. | Look what I found. 
  We have to go back?| We don't have to, we get to! Come on. 
  We don't have to, we get to! Come on. | See? That didn't take long at all. Now we get treasure.
  Okay.|  Nope. This key's for something else. Haha. Oh, well. 
   Jeez. This is kinda boring. At least he's walking fast.| See? That's where I found the key.
  See? That's where I found the key.| Snapdragons!!
  Scatter fire! | No, no, we shake them down first, remember?
  He... wanted me to take his place.|  Man. Ooh, hold on.  Ha ha! It's another key! Now we get to go back to the beginning!  Whoohoo!
  Finn, I'm not having any fun.|  What? Why?
  Well, you keep wanting me to do things your way. But I don't like doing things your way. Is that because I am evil?| What? No, wait, that's... no! Uhh, hey, you know what? Let's do things your way.
  Really?| Yeah. I've been acting an uncouth lout, m'lady.  Okay, so there's a door over there. What do you wanna do?
  I... burn it down. | Okay, that worked. Now what do you do...
   RRAAAAAGGGHHH!!| Uhh...  Good- good job, FP.
  Thanks, FTH! Haa!  Ughh, doors! Burn, burn, burn!  Huh? Ugh.| Oh, Sham man. It's the legion of Goo Skulls! Uh, how do you defend?
  Uhh... snake fire!! | Fire burn goo.
  Yes! Feel my flames, puny worms!  The power of destruction!| Woh.   Whoa! Flame Princess!!
  Huh? | Ahh!!!
   Do the splits! Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!   | Hot Daniel! Flame Princess. I thought you were going to burn me alive.
  Ha, thanks Finn. That was a really awesome experience.| Dungeons totes clear your head, right?
   I forget how good it feels to destroy stuff.|  Uhhhh.....
  I mean, like evil stuff.| Oh yeah, cool.
  We should go again sometimes. Do you know any other dungeons?| Maybe next time we should just go to like... a farmer's market.
  And burn it.| Hmm, try this key.
  Hmm, try this key.| What is it?
  Hey, Finn! How's the mission going?|So far, no sign of the Bird Man. Why's this guy so dangerous?
 Some say he's a half-man, half-bird that poops fire while he flies. It's all rumors so far. That's why I need you and Jake to find out everything you can about him and report back to me.|Where are you?
 Under the sea. The mermaids are trying to beach themselves. I came to see why. Turns out they're just lonely. |Maybe I'll go hang out with them after this biz.
 Sounds great, Finn.|Okay. Bye, PB.
 C'mon, let's go look for that creep!|Whoa.
 Whoa.| Huh? Where am I?
 This is the rookery, where I and my bird friends dwell!|So are you, like, the Great Bird Man?
 Oh, no, my change has been deep. And these whatsits are only curtains for empty windows.|Whoa. What happened there?
 Om.|What are you doing?
 Oh, Taffy! You heard my call!  Climb aboard, boys.  Taffy will take us to the lower level, and you can have a bite to eat!|Oh, uh, me and Jake will follow you. Jake needs to stretch out and stuff.
 Okay, great! Well, follow me!|It's crazy, right?! The way dude's eyeballs are just hangin' there.
 I know! I almost told him 'cause it was driving me nuts!|Yeah, me too!
 Do you think he's got evil intentions behind his reborn star-child act?|I don't know. But if he does, I'm gonna find out.
 They're small, but they sure can take a lot out of you. Whoo! Dizzy. Sometimes feeding really wipes me out. I hope you'll excuse me while I refocus my qi.  See you in a while!|Now's our chance to do some snooping.
 Now's our chance to do some snooping.|Jake!  I found his weapon stash!
  Hmm.|What is it? A fighting stick? A dagger?
 This one's a letter from the hospital.|You can read those bumps with your fingers?
 Yeah, I learned braille from my ex.|Your ex was blind?
" Nah, just cool.  ""Dear Xergiok, thank you so much for your donation. The kidneys fit great.""  Well, geez, maybe he has changed his ways!"|Maybe. Let's keep looking.
  Doy!|Oh!
 Psychic links! Cardamom, my friend, I'm coming! I'm com—  Mother of Gob! Hold on, Cardy!  Okay, here I am, buddy. Ol' Xergy's here.  Let's see now—  Aw, dang! |Wha—?
 Ah, Finn and Jake, you are here!|Where'd you learn that heal spell?
 I use no magic. I manipulated space with a vibrational chant. You see, now the injury has transferred to me!  Ooh, yeah, that hurts, baby! Whoo! Can't you see, Jake? I love these birds more than I love myself. What am I to the deafening roar of the macro-cosmos? Nothing much. Just a vessel to carry the message of friendship to y'all beasts and dirt!|Dirt?
 Yeah, look!  Hello, friends! Go for a ride!|Listen, man. About your eyes.
 Yes, a wizard stole them.|Alright, but not— 
 Finn! What are you doing, man?|Dude, he's changed!
 Are you sure?|Uh, yeah, man. Isn't it kind of obvi?
 Alright. Oh, where are they? |Dude, your eyes are in your beard.
 A-ha, what? Good job, guys. Goofin' on the blind guy—real nice!|No, man, they're right here. 
 What my life?!|We didn't tell you 'cause we thought you might still be a wong lord!
 And these aren't grapes, right?|No, man.
 Oh, Whisper Dan! That's cool. Cool, cool. Hey, you guys wanna ride back to your crib?|Yeah, sure, man.
 I know, but I was thinking—now that I'm wiser, I could rule as king again!|That idea is terrible.
  Oh, yeah, baby!|Come on, man. Are you for real?
 Here, Finn. Take my eyes and bury them forever. I will not need them again.|Okay, man. 
 Bye!|Dude, that sucks. I hope he finds peace, or something.
 Maybe he's thirsty.  Oops, I guess he was just sad.|Should we save him?
 Nah, man, he's fine.|What the—?
  Ha-ha-ha. Okay, now make him look angrier!| Alright, give me a second.
  Nope, not funny anymore. Sorry, dude—you ruined it.| Man, I don't have patience for this animation junk. Whoever does this must have no life whatsoev—
  Man, I don't have patience for this animation junk. Whoever does this must have no life whatsoev—| Oof... Why did I do that?
  Yo Finn, did you order a brick?| Hm, I don't think so.
   False alarm; it's just an email.| Who's it from?
  Eeeww!| Escape, Jake! Escape!
  Alright, alright, hold on.  Oh man! Thing must've had a computer worm in it!| Whaa? Aaaah!
  P-bubs! P-bubs, P-bubs!| The computer went...
  Open video and...| The email...
  Potato trampoline...| Brick window with the plastic...
  Then crashment!| Banana hummingbird...
 Other| How do we stop the computer worm, you pile of goo?!
 Other| STOP TALKING LIKE A NERD AND GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT!!!
   AAAAAHH! MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!! MY HOPES AND DREAMS—RUINED!!! | Don't worry, Princess, we'll take care of this thing.
  Oh, me too.  I'm gonna take care of it, too. | Okay! 
  Okay! |  Don't worry, guy! I got you!  YEOW! JAKE, HELP ME!!!
   Okay, shh, you're safe! | Come here, guy!
  No... Stay away from me!| I'm trying to help you, yo!
  I saw what happened when you picked up Todd. | But... No!! Jake, this isn't working! We need a plan.
  Aw, man. Okay, here is my dream plan. You were wearin' tights made of green feathers. These tiny green feathers. And I was this wisecracking coelacanth that only ate popcorn. Anyway, we were in this—| THAT PLAN'S NOT GOOD!
  Hold on, I'm almost done. So we were trapped inside this huge egg, and after a while you started dancing in this kind of sign language. And then Ice King's glitchy stuff started eatin' my dream up. I peed in my pants, but you went up and talked to it. You just... talked to it.| Then talk to it I will.  Hey man, tell me the haps.
  AAAAAAAAAAH...!!!|  Jake, I think I found a way in!
  No, wait, dude. I think I cracked the code!| There's no time! 
  AAAAAAH!!!| AAAAH... AAH!!!
  This must be the universal source code!| Huh? Ice King and Bubblegum?
  Huh? Ice King and Bubblegum?| Jake! Don't touch anything!
  Huh?| I think the shiny things are the building blocks of the universe, man! They store every single thing that is a thing back on thing!
  Okay, enough exploring already. Where is this glitch guy? I'm gonna smash his jimmies. | Jake, what is it?
 Other| Come on, Jake, pull it together, man.
  Come on, Jake, pull it together, man.| Jake?
   Let's do this... for Righty!| That's the spirit!  ADVENTURE TI--!!!  Oh, my gams!! Hold up, dude, my body's changing! 
  So, hey, Finn, how do you plan on taking this guy out?| 
  Aah! What we do now?| We gotta get those things... outta his stomach.
  Hey, Finn! Remember that gross video Ice King sent?|  Ugh, yeah.  Yeah!!
  You should wash your hair!| You should wash your mouth! 
  Everything back to normal, huh? | Seems like it. 
   Aah! My face!! My beautiful face is back to normal!!! Aaah!!!! | Hey, have you seen the princess anywhere?
  I missed you, too!  Whoa, you taste different, baby! You been playin' basketball in someone else's hockey rink?| Ahem... Hey, Bubs, where's the Ice King? I wanna kick his boingloings! 
  Uuf!| Come on, Jake...
  Sorry buddy,  just trying to cheer you up some. I mean here you are chillin' out with history's coolest friends, building an actual pillow fort, but you just sit there sulking--I mean, what gives!?|  I guess I'm just thinking about Flame Princess. I told her a joke the other day and she didn't even laugh or anything. I guess it's over between us.
  Maybe she just didn't get it yet.| Yeah right, BMO. More like she used up all her laughs on some other guy's jokes probably. Man, having a girlfriend is hard.
   Oh no! My favorite window!| I don't even know what you guys are talking about. I think I just need some alone time.  Gotta let my mind fester a bit, you know? I'll be back in a little while. 
   Finn! Festering is always bad, man! There's no good kind of festering! Finn!| Man, this looked smaller from the outside. What's this now? What the?! Jake, what's in here?! Jake?
  Oh, whoa!  Did Jake build this part too? That guy needs some more girlfriends or something.|  Hey Jake! You need more girlf--what the...? Door's gone?
   Hey Jake! You need more girlf--what the...? Door's gone?| Hmm, maybe there's another door in yonder pillow town.  I don't get this at all.
  Dragon!! Blanket Dragon! Run!| Huh?
   Oof! Hey mistah, you betta get wunnin'! Bwanket Dwagon!| Now this, I understand!    Oh. That's it?
   Did you see that?| Hey, uh, how's it going?
  Puhoy there! I am Quilton, son of Pillowford, and you have saved our village! You and your sharp pillow.| Hah, it's nothing; I kill things all the time.
  | 
  There you are, Finn the Human.| Oh, hey there... Um, you can just call me Finn if you want.
  All right, Finn. My name is Roselinen, daughter of Quilton. You have to call me the whole thing.| Oh, uh...
  Just kidding!| Heh. Oh, uh, your dad seems fun.
   Yeah. Um, you wanna dance?| Oh, well...  I...have a girlfriend. 
    Dummy, it's a dance, not marriage.|  Yeah, okay!  This place is weird.
   Are you telling me that birds in your world don't poo little pillowcases?| Naah, just regular poo.
  Hey, like this. | Eh, yeah, i-it's really cool. Where I come from, I live with my best friend, who's my brother. And he's a dog. We fight stuff; it's cool. It's really different than here. I mean, where I'm from, blankets and pillows are used for bedding.
   Well they're used for that here too.|  Heh heh uh.
  Woo oo ooh hoo hoo! Pill-ightful!| Ah man, it's been nice, Roselinen. But I gotta get back to my home.  Quilton, I need your help to find a portal to my home world.
  Please, share our food. You need nourishment.|   It tastes... like... a pillow...
  Yes!|   Alphanumeric!  Pillow sheep! You have more fluff than sense! 
  Daddy!| Oh!  What is this!  A pack of fearsome pillow goblins?!
  Psst, Finn, they've brought you lunch.| Oh, they have, have they?  Tiny pillows. Mmm mmm mm mmm.
  |  Darling, you've outdone yourself.
  Oh oh oh, come here! Oh, but I've come to speak with your father.| What is it, Quilton?
  When you first arrived here, you told us of a mysterious door that led you to our world.| Yes, of course.
  Archaeologists found this in the Pillow Catacombs| Oh my glob.
  There is no information about the door, save for the fact it shows up periodically, and then disappears.| Quilton, I need to find that door. 
  Jake, you drive a hard burger.|  Hello?
  Ah yes, come in.| Are these The Great Abracadabra Mountains? And are you Rasheeta the Great Oracle, dweller of said mountains?
  Yes, you must be Finn the Human Man, seeker of the wandering portal.| Yes, I've searched for decades--how did you know?
  I've read it in the Tea Leaves,  this newspaper I found from the future.| Does it say how I get home?
  The real question is| Uh... yeah!
  Well don't worry, you won't be here long. | So there is another way to...  Oof...
  Not long now. | Oh... 
  What did the oracle say, father? Have we come to the right spot finally?| I think so, but the oracle spoke in riddles.  Gonna have to fester on this one for a bit...
  Oh, Finn. I know you have to go, all these years I've known, but now that it's time...  Oh man, I'm just all messed up about it. Just promise me you'll remember us,  when you're back in your real life.| Hmm, that reminds me, Roselinen, of something Jake told me just before I came to this world.
   You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems, stay with your new wife. You've known her longer now than any of us. You're not even sure if I ever really existed. And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like this.|  Man. How did he see it all coming so clearly?  Come on, everyone. Pack your things, we're going home.
  Finn... Finn.|  Wha—where?
  Are you comfortable?| I'm... alright.
    That... we love you dad.|  I remember... back... when I was dad.
   Dad, you are dad...|  I ain't dad yet! Oh, no, wait! Here it comes! Woo hoo hoo hoo hooooo, BOY! 
   I ain't dad yet! Oh, no, wait! Here it comes! Woo hoo hoo hoo hooooo, BOY! | HUP! 
  Hey buddy, you feeling better already?| Huh? Oh. Uhh, I don't know, man. I just had the number one wildest dream.
  Really?| Yeah! I was--  Hello? Oh hey! Oh.  Yeah, thanks! Yeah, okay, bye.  That was Flame Princess. She said she didn't get my joke until just now and that it's really funny and awesome!
  Yeah, that's great man. Now what about this dream?| What dream?
  The dream you were just talking about.| Huh?
  Just a second ago!| 
  The dream you just had in the pillow fort!|  Pfft!
 Naw, man, I'm in the kitchen making us breakfast.|I call 'not answer the door' then.
 Bubble? Bubble?  No! No no no, my Bubble! No!! |What's so funny?
 Oh, it's just BMO, he's pretending to be all messed up because his bubble got popped. |Oooh, heh haha, that is pretty funny.
 Heeey, yooou...| Ow ow, ow! 
  Your shoe rash is gross, man.  Oh, I'm gonna throw up!  Ah, I'm just kidding!| Man, I wish I had my other sock, this callous is gonna junk up my good time at PB's potluck.
  Don't worry man, we're going to have a ton of fun. We'll eat some melon, I'll get some compliments on my pretty makeup.| You look like a target.
   Does everyone have a tray?|   Bounce House! Come on, Jake!  Bounce bounce! 
  Oh ho. Oh, hi Finn.| Oh my goodness, sorry Bounce House Princess, I didn't know it was you.
  Ah ha, that's okay, you wanna go inside, bounce around a little? |  Mmm that's okay. Come on, Jake. Let's, eh, go party.
  Hey guys.|  Hello. Hello, Princess Princess Princess, hey, Embryo Princess, heeey youuu.
  What's up with the limp?| I've been going foot nude in the shoe and now I got this turbo huge callous. 
  Well, sit down and relax. Oh, by the way, I've entered everyone's name into a raffle and the winner gets whatever is in that. | Mysterious. Oh, brought something for the party!
  Oh, how wonderful!| Bam! Soda!
  Oh...| It's warm and I shook it up... a lot.
 Other| 
  Meow...| Awww, hey Jake, check out this cat.
  I don't like cats, man! | Do you like fresh lemon in your ice tea?
  Yes.| 
 Other| Hmm, hey, Gunter, let me get one of them socks.
  | Oh... ow.
  Ow! Hey, everyone, take refuge in my body! | Ice King, don't make me stand up and whomp you!
 Other| That's.... IT! 
 Other| Why are you doing this, IK?!
 Other| Only if you promise to stop acting nanners.
  It's time for the raffle. And the winner is.... Finn.| Whoa, cool.
   Congrats, Finn, you won a... Sea Lard.  Here you go.| Awesome.
 I think he broke his egg.|Hey, it's okay BMO. Look, Jake and I will make you a funny face. 
 Hey, BMO, this will cheer ya up! | What the?! 
 Oh, man, James Baxter is so good, man. He always knows just what to say to cheer a guy up!|Yeah, man.
 So good!|Man, we should do it to! Do his thing and spread the good will!
 Yeah, man, I wanna be like James Baxter, always rollin' in on a beach ball, saying his name in a horse voice, making people smile.  Let's do it!| Yeah!
  Yeah!| Finn the Human!
  Jake!| Finn!
  Sheesh, tough crowd.| I think we should find an easier person to cheer up. It was a mistake to visit a funeral.
 |That is so perfect!
 James Baxter! James Baxter!|Man, what's he doing that we're not? We just gotta figure that out.
 Why am I recording?|You're documenting our creative flow in case we make a breakthrough.
 Dude, I think we do got something.|Let's check the video.
 |Yeah, right there, speed it up.
 |Slow it down.
 |
 Yeah, that sounds makes me feel happy!|Good, good, happy is what we want.
 BMO, zoom in on my mouth |"Yeah, it's good,  but if we want to be ""James Baxter"" good, we gotta to go deeper."
 The Institute of So Und.| Hey, hey man!
  I receive you. Welcome to the Sound Institute of So Und.|Where is the studio to make the best feel-good sound?
 Just think happy thoughts and follow the beat of your heart.|Hold up.... This way... 
 These sounds make feel-good, right here. |Right here.  Good!
 I feel it here,  good here!|We know to figure out how to make our sound...  force happiness into the listener!
 Check our data?|Maybe it should be higher?
 Yeah, maybe, maybe it could be lower, I don't know.| Let's both agree that that sound belongs there. 
 See that sound? I drew that sound connected to two other sounds. |Hmm, something's missing. 
 That's it, the missing thing in our thing!|Yeah, James Baxter don't just got his catch phrase, he has his beach ball bizz!
 So we gotta create feel good body actions to go with our feel good sound!|We just crushed it, homie.
  Dude, seriously, I think our thing is gonna change the world. When people experience it, it's going to make them so happy!| You're building it up too much.  Let's just do it.
 Let's just do the thing.|Right, okay! 
 |Dude!!  
 WHY HAVE YOU UPSET MY DEAL?!|Jake, come on man, I need some help!
  Sorry, I act like a little kitty cat!|Whoa,  it's milk!
  Eeeee, he broke my squishy bones!| Don't worry, Jake, I'll block this one!
  Finn, when we wake up in the 9th Dead World, promise me you'll listen for this sound |What?
 Holy cow!  Hey, man, this guy really knows how to cheer a guy up!  He's awesome, do you know this guy! |Well, sort of.
"  ""I'm not talking today""  "|" ""Me too"" "

 | ???
 Ow, ow! Okay fine! Uncle uncle, please stop pinching me Bikini Babe!.| Oh, I win!  you're so disappointed. 
 Finn? Jake? For real?|We were just playing a game, BMO. It all started this morning when Jake made a sign that said-
 Hey, guys.|Hey, PB,  what's up?
  This is a soul stone.  I need one for something I'm working on. Of course, it's really rare, but my scanners found one. It's in the Vapor Swamps.  I printed the map with all the detail.|PB, who's the new guy?
 What? |Hey, man. 
 Oh, that's Braco, a suitor of mine.|Oh, cool. That's cool—you're dating, that's coool. See ya, Princess.
 Oh, cool. That's cool—you're dating, that's coool. See ya, Princess.|What'd ya think of that Braco guy? I mean, he seems kinda weird  and passive and baby lambish  and too unheroic for Peebs.  And then I smashed that peach!
  Jake and Finn, I seek your aid. I need to ask you for that map, therewith I can bring the soul stone to Bubblegum. Then she'll love me!|That road you're on leads to nowhere. 
 Other| Ice King, get out of Princess-
 Never mind that, the real question is what's that slo-mo Finn know about this?|Hey BMO, where's Jake?
 Jake got back with his old gang and is going to rob the Candy Kingdom!| OK, BMO.
 |You wanna join my primitive noise band? 
 No, I like organized sound.|Pssssh! 
   Sounds like my little baby girl wanna build a time machine!|Ooooh!
 OK, you guys have fun! I'm gonna get some more juice.  Mom has some weird taste in men. | Pssst. She's going back!
  Ding-ding!  Scre-e-e-ech! |  Hello? Oh! Is that the machine part that I ordered?
  You just gotta sign for it, to prove you accepted delivery. | Ac-cept-tance.
 M-m-m-m, what a jerk.|What, a jerk?
 Yeah, just give it a little jerk.|
 |Now that's a time machine.
 Aw, that's OK.  It was just make-believe, anyways.|O-ho-ho, was it? Then how do you explain tomorrow's newspaper?
  Hey! I was trying to read that!|That book is above your level.
 What business are you into?|None of your business!
  Talk about it over lunch?| Heh, if you're buying.
  Hey!| Hey!
  Oops.| LSP! Who robbed you?
  I think I gave her too much.| Jake. A crime has been committed. We must find the criminal.
  We must.|  And retrieve whatever it is that was stolen from Lumpy Space Princess.
   Stolen. But all we have to go on is part of a name. Pete something.  Need more clues! Hold me! | Clues, clues, clues.
  | What's that? I can't see it.
  Oop, sorry.  Aah!| There's something in her hand!  A key! A key to...what? Three zero three. Hmm.
   Ooh, turn it around! | Ah!  Looks like we've got our first lead!
  Ah!  Looks like we've got our first lead!| Hmm. Find anything, Jake?
   Got some bags and...wait-  more bags. But no leads on Pete something.|  Same here. BMO.  Start marking evidence.
  Hmm.| Hmm.
   Hmm.|  Dude, check this!  Is this blood?
  Yeah man, that's definitely blood.| Hmm. LSP's injuries were 100 percent emotional. So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. BMO, take a sample and do a full blood analysis.  The works.  Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There's a drugstore across the street!
   Let's roll. | Woah!
  And if the oozing persists, just come back   and I'll give you something a little stronger.|  I'm Finn. This is my partner, Jake. 
  A lot of people come through my store, gentlemen. You can't seriously think I'd be able to remember any one particular customer among the countless others I see on a daily basis, now, can you?| I guess not. Fair dues. C'mon, Jake.
   Wait! Now that you mention it, there was this one guy in here earlier. Real suspicious type. Had a nosebleed. Said it was the first one he'd had in years.  Used to get them all the time as a kid, he said.  Can never remember if he was supposed to pinch his nose and hold his head back, or pinch his nose and hold his head forward.  Maybe it was a case of being boxed on the nose too many times.  Made the blood vessels in his lower septum weak and vulnerable to hemorrhaging. Anyway, his mammy always said it was because he couldn't keep all those picky little fingers out of his dirty little nose holes.  He didn't buy it though. He always thought it had-| Ma'am, can you give us a name?
  Mmm, nope. No wait, yes I can. Pete Sassafras.| Did you catch which way he was going?
  See anyone who might be our guy?|  Nope.  Nobody's suspicious here. Just a load of decent law-abiding folk.  What the-?! Jake! What's with all the turning into stuff today?
  I really like turnin' into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff.  Hey, there's Platform 5!  I see a nasty tranch!| Let's book him, son.
  Let's book him, son.|  Stop right there! What's under that skeezy trenchcoat ya-
   Crook!  Busted! For attempting to board a train without a ticket.| Oh, guys, he's getting away!
   Sorry about that, officers, it was an honest mistake.|  Ugh. We lost him.
  Not yet we didn't! | Ugh! It's too far ahead! We'll never catch it.
  If we cut through the forest, maybe we can head it off at the pass.| Sweet thinkin'.
  Yeah!| Are you Pete Sassafras?
  Who? What's that, an acronym or somethin'?| Cuff 'em.
  Save it for the candy judge, Pete.| Look, you can cut the act and drop the sass, Sassafras. We've got an eye-witness and your blood at the scene of the crime.
  You do the crime, you do the time, man!| Roll the dice, you pay the price.
   Welcome to the next twenty-five years of your life.|  We deserve donuts.
  Guilty! | Man, we didn't just crack that case, we crunched it! Crumbled it!
  We are awesome at being cops!  No question about that.|  Call me crazy, but I was thinking maybe we should actually become detectives. Like, as a job! When we were out on the streets back there, getting those leads, busting that perp, it just felt so...I don't know...right.
   I know, man. I actually totally do know exactly what you mean.|  Aw, dude. 
   Howdy, partner.| Oh hey, BMO. What's going on?
  I finished processing the blood sample. And I have the result.| Nice!
  Yeah, good work, BMO!| It's Pete Sassafras's blood, right?
  Tomato sauce?|" Hmm...  Oh my mind! LSP wasn't trying to say ""Pete Sa-something""; she was trying to say ""Pizza something!"""
  But how would pizza sauce end up in a hotel room?|  Unless it was delivered.
  Pizza Sassy's!| Where's the delivery guy?!
   Or maybe he's out tying up loose ends!|  LSP could be in danger!
  Danger! | Phone?
  Phone. |  Princess! Have some Banana Guards outside of LSP's hospital room!
  Huh? Why?| LSP could be in danger!
  LSP woke up and went back to her hotel room.|  OH MY JAM!!!
  Help me! I was just delivering the pizzas she ordered. And now she won't let me leave.| LSP, what is going on? You said he stole something from you.
  He did! He stole...my heart! | Hurry up, dude!
  Shh!| Right.
  Thanks!| Shh. Go, go!
 You still think I'm a jerk?  All right, sit tight.|How is he?
 Yo, that stinks! Tonight's part 3 of his graveyard secrets workshop.|Yeah, prubs, give him the mediçon.
  Have you two been to Wizard City?|"Nope. ""Wizards only."""
 Wizards don't play.|Trespassers get killed mad quick, like zap-zap.
 Well, then what?|Let's stay home. Just kidding.
  H-hurry, princess.|This is it?
 Yeah, man, this is it.|Well, what's with the wall?
 Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-op! |What's over there?
 Nothing. Just more mountains. I think the wall knows we're not wizards.|But we can trick it, right?
 How do you trick a wall?|Don't know, man. I give up.
 For reals?|Yeah, I'm no good at this!  Unh! Oof!
 Other|Whoa.  Powerful magicks.
 Yeah, right. Just 'cause I know my shnoz.  Look at these dopes. Half of these spells are all working on entanglement principles.|"""Entanglement"" is a spell where you get trapped in tree roots, and sometimes they spike out and hook your flesh, and you got to be like, ""My body is clay, my spirit feels no pain."" Then you chop your way out and kill the wizard!"
 That's not what I meant, but whatevs. Where's this magic shop?| These signs are weird. Let's ask somebody. Hey, dudes.  Yo, where's the--
 Stand back, citizen.|Yeesh. Okay. Who are these guys?
 Woaah!|Oh, my shrah!
 Come on.|You saw that, right?
  Y'all is fakes!| No, wait!
  Yoink!  Dang. |  Hey, Jake?
  What?| Is PB straight-up naked right now?
  Huh? Do I know you?| Dude, it's me, Finn! Quick, let us in!
  Please!| Come on, man!
  Shush!|  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
  Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want trouble!| Just let us rest for a bit.
   Hey, guys, wait for me!| Shush!
  Somebody better start crying into my hand!| Ugh! That's sick!
   You're right. I'm so ashamed. | Ugh!
  Come on! Move it!  You two, in here! I got cells upstairs for Princess and Milkface.|  I got traumatized by those underpanties.  This sucks.
  Hey, let's count the days.  One.|  Hey, PB, are you okay?
  PB! Over here! | Whoa! 
  BRING IT ON. | What?! Are you two crazy?!
  I've had it with you silly wizards!| Jake, we have to do something!
  Jake, we have to do something!| We need to get out of this.
  Yeah, we still got to heal the snuffins out of Starchie with this little baby here. |  All this for a cold spell.  What the-? Ice?  Hmm.
  Sorry, but you have to kill him. Otherwise, we'll kill all of yous two both.| Peebs! Incoming! 
  What?| It's a cold spell, not a cold spell.
   Whoa! | Get down! 
  Get down! | Your magicks are powerful, PB.
  Okay. Let's get out of here.| Poor Starchie. All that trouble and we couldn't get any magic for him.
  Yeah! Woo woo!| Man, it's been so long since I've worn the Jakesuit. I forgot how awesome your bod is, bro. Stretchy-arm power!  I feel unstoppable!  Bam! And I don't even feel it!   BMO, throw your plate at me!
  Okay! | Yeah, BMO, show me the stuff, keep it coming!  Yeah, BMO, unleash the beast!
  Yah! Unleash the beast! | Come on, BMO, bring it, that's nothing!   You're weak, BMO!
  Come on, BMO, bring it, that's nothing!   You're weak, BMO!| You OK, BMO?
  I am no match for the Jakesuit.| That's right!
  That's right!| Dog, the Jakesuit is mad strong! This junk could protect me from anything!
   Uh, sorta. Wait, bro, what are you doing up here? You know I'm not actual armor, right?| Septuple flip off the tree house! 
  Nooo!| Ride 'em cowboy! Woo!
  You were a little rough with the Jakesuit today, bro. You mashed up my doggy bag pretty hard.| Why didn't you stop me?
  When you're in my body, it pushes out my brain, so I have no control.| C'mon bro, taking pain is easy. You just have to imagine that every bruise is a hickey from the Universe. And everyone wants to get with the Universe. 
  I bet you wouldn't be saying that nonsense if I wore you as a suit.| I bet I would be saying that nonsense.
  OK bro, let's see how you like it. I'll bring the pain!| Do it bro, get in here!
  Eh?|  Man, are you kidding?
  You give up?| You have to like, punch me in the face.
  Hmm. I thought I was. This is hard. I can't even make a fist. How do you control my body so well?| Dude, I'm graceful. Mom raised me graceful.
  Dude, I'm graceful. Mom raised me graceful.|  Dude, what the Bjork?
  A-ha! Here we go! Dream Journal of a Boring Man, Volume 12.| Uh, Jake, what are you doing?
  There's all kinds of pain, Finn.| Dude, come on, don't do this.
  Huh? Where am I?  Oh, yeah. Hey, Finn, how long have I been out?| I don't know. A couple hours
  Say what?! Why are you still reading?|" It's actually not that bad. There's a bunch where he knows he's dreaming. Here, let me read you a little.  ""So I said to the first guy, if everyone in my dream is me, then you are me. And he said, I am who? And I said, me. And he said, who is me? And I said, you.  And he said, what about you? And I said, no you!""  It's like he's trying to solve a mystery that doesn't exist! You want me to keep going?"
  No, I'm hungry.| Yeah, I'm hungry too. How about a truce while you go make us some lunch?
  Oh, I didn't know we were allowed to call truces. I'll totally remember that the next time my doggy bag is hurtling towards a fence post.| You know, you could use the opportunity of cooking me food to mess with me.
   Wait a sec, you just gave me an idea!| Yeah?  Uh-oh. Oh, look out, you gonna make me something gross? Soemthing spicy? You know I can take it! 
  Ta-da!| Meatloaf? That's my favorite dish.
  Mmm-mmm.| What did you do to it?
  I assure you, it's delicious.| Okay, well, you're really terrible at this. 
  Yummy!| Oh, that's just mean.
  Admit you're wrong, and you can have some of this delicious meatloaf!| Nah, I'm good.
  Nah, I'm good.| Jake, it's my special occasion phone! Someone's calling me to tell me about a special occasion.
  So?| So can you walk me over there? I wanna see who it is!  Oh, it's Flame Princess.  I'll talk to her later. I don't want you embarrassing me or, uh, anything. Jake?
  So can you walk me over there? I wanna see who it is!  Oh, it's Flame Princess.  I'll talk to her later. I don't want you embarrassing me or, uh, anything. Jake?| Jake! Seriously, don't do this!
  Tell me I win, dude!| No, absolutely not.
  Oh, hey, you came! I got worried because you didn't answer special occasion phone. My relatives are waiting inside.| What?
  Finn, this is my family.  These are my two younger brothers, my brother who's home from the military, and my judgmental aunt and uncle. |  Jake, whatever you're about to do, please don't do it.
  Good luck, Finn. Hope you win!| I will!
  Yes!| So, what are we doing, bro? 
  The Universe is going to have a full-on make-out session with you, bro. I'm talkin' minimum tier 8. Behold!| Fire Wolves? That's your plan? Please.
  How you like it, bro? Pretty painful, huh?| Eh, whatev.
  Eh, whatev.| Hmm. Looks hot.
  Oh yeah, bro! The pain-train has arrived at the station! Choo-choo! | I'm ready, bro! Bring it! You're nothin', lava! You're a bum! I can handle you!
  Look, just say stop, and you won't get burned.|  Never!
  Okay, bro. This'll pretty much wreck up your whole life, so think about it.| Bring it! Yeah, baby, feels good, love it, lovin' that heat on my skull!
  Okay...I'm gonna lower you some more...probably gonna cook up your brain.| Oh, yeah, give it to me!
   Dang, he's flippin' crazy! This isn't gonna do anything, he's never gonna give up!| What happened? You robbed me of the win!
  You're right, man. My bruises are hickeys from the Universe. And I should just accept that.| Yeah boy! In yo' face!
  We'll start with full-body immersion therapy. |  No!
  Hello?| BMO?
  BMO?| BMO, are you okay?
  It wasn't me. I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing. | Come on BMO. We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs.
  No, no. I am fine. Really.  Oh, yes. Okay. Please take me to get fixed. I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed. We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands, where I was born.|The MO Factory?
 Okay. Now straight down this place. Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here. The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened... or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven!|Tears in the oven?  But memories are real, real cruc'!
   Wow!| Hey BMO, check this out, too!  Meet FMO.
  Hey there, DMO. I am JMO.| And I'm FMO!
  Greetings, JMO. FMO, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair?| Yes, absolutely. Thanks, DMO. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones.
  Fantastic. Okay. Please get ready for your total personality wipe.| Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for the... nostalgic purposes.
  Greetings. | Wup!
   Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are!| I know, I heard!
  Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'!| None of these ports fit right! E, D, C, where's the B port?!
  Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there.  So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'?|  BMO, how are you doing?
  Dang, man, how deep does this place go?| Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.  Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.
  Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.  Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.| Psych! 
  Hey, woah!| Down that grate!
  Cram your tram!  Womp!| Hang in there, BMO!
  Hang in there, BMO!| Hey, Jake! Can this thing go any fast-
  Hey, Jake! Can this thing go any fast-| Woah! Shoot, it's the fuzz!
  Hit 'em again!| Holy-
  Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?!| Uh, turn right!
  Uh, turn right!| Dog it, they're still behind us! 
  Dog it, they're still behind us! | Turn left!
  Turn left!| Turn Corkscrew!
  Turn Corkscrew!| Now go down!
  Now go down!| There's a driver port!
  There's a driver port!| Too spicy.
  Hey, I'm Moe!  Don't worry! My legs don't work!| You're Moe?! Wait, are you human, too?
  Hey, come on, now!  It is BMO! Looks like there's some software problems!  Hmm.| So...you made BMO?
  Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son.  Oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's sad.  I sent BMO off into the world alone.  Hoping to find a family home. And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.| Aw.
  Wait, did you say you built a million robots?| Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks!
  Anyway, recent data shows an increased chance of threat to the Candy Kingdom.| 
   Finn? Finn?| Sorry.
  Finn, I'm bored. Are you sure Princess Bubblegum doesn't like me anymore?| Yeah. That's what she said.
  Sounds weird. Are you lying so you can do this dinner thing alone with Bubblegum?| No way!
  I don't know if this is a good idea after your break-up with Flame Princess. PB is out of your age range, anyway.| No way, man, I got no expectates. Whatever happens happens.
   Hey Finn! Let's go.| Lates, bro.  Comin'!
  Lates, bro.  Comin'!| Hey-ey, things got fancy around here.
  Thanks again for coming to Castle Lemongrab with me, Finn. I kinda hate these diplomatic dinners. Also, I think the Lemongrabs are getting weirder.| Oh, uh, you know me—pretty good with weird stuff.
  It's just a shame that Jake didn't wanna come. I love Jake.| Yeah. We all love Jake. 
  It's... dinner time! | Yo, Peebs. How's your lemon?
   No, you're floating too high!  It's time for the floor show!| Hey, princess! Look who happens to carry a flute with him. 
  Ugh, I can't watch this any more. Excuse me, Finn. | Okay. Let me know if you get lonely!
   We need to free that darling boy. Maybe there's something in the Candy Kingdom-Lemon Earldom treaty. I don't think there is.| What about a prank?
  Finn, what are you talking about?| Mmm, I don't know. Maybe if we prank Lemongrab, like, just right, they'll let us take that guy home? Yeah. Prank.
  I don't see how that's going to help us at all.| Pranks, like old times.
  Finn, no, that's really—hmm... okay, yeah! We'll pull a prank. Like old times.| Okay.  Puddin'  Bakin' soder.  Vinegar.  And the bait.  Now when Lemongrab stirs his pud  splode-cano.
  Ah, my pud! I'm going to enjoy this pud. I'm really looking forward to this pud.  Oh, what is this?| A-ha! Now give us back Lemonhope or prepare for mo' pranks!
  Dungeon!|  Guess I must admit. One would have a hard time claiming that to have been a pretty good plan. Sorry, PB.
  No, no. Your plan was great, Finn.  See? What's this? Huh?  Your flute. Wow, now Lemonhope can play it and the Lemongrabs will come open the door to smash the flute and we can all escape! Really great work, Finn.| Oh.
   How dare you? How dare you release my prisoners? Soft Lemongrab! Softer than an old graham cracker! YOU'RE SOFT!! | Yike! 
  Oh, no! We're locked in. Finn, give me your phone, I'm calling Jake!| What? No! Let's, um... we could do another prank! I brought some of your super-spicy hot sauce! Ah, so spice!
  Finn, this is serious!| But, my other plan worked.
  Finn, your other plan failed, which was part of my plan, which worked.| Your plan? But I thought we were having fun together.
  Finn, I have citizens who need me. I can't always treat everything like a little boy game.| Oh. Yeah, no, that's cool.
  Sorry, sir.| Get to safety, princess! I'll hold 'em off.
  Sorry, sir! | Wait, so do you not like any games, or just little boy games?
  Yo, man, how's it going? Terrible?| Well, yeah, mostly. But I think I learned something.
  Go on.| Well, I'm thinkin' maybe age isn't just a number. Maybe older people, like, really are different. Y'know? Like, less fun inside.
  So whatcha saying here?| I'm saying I think I really sponked up. I gotta patch things up with Flame Princess.
  Oh, dang! Didn't you hear? She's got a new boyfriend already!| What?!
  Ha-ha! I win!| Oh, hey, man.
  Common cucumber! Sliced Roma tomato. Sweet yellow onion—organic.  Oh, almost done.  Tears for salt. Meat prepared sous-vide. ♪Bacon.♪  You're the most important part.  Lobster soul.  It's amazing! Ohhh,  this is the greatest sandwich I've ever made!|Is it glowing?
 You guys want some?|It's cool, man. I know you want to eat the whole thing, and I'm cool with that.
 What the?|Jake, wait!
  What's he doin' in there? Why did he freeze himself with my sandwich?|He's not frozen. He's super slow-mozin', motion. Look.
 Aww, that's gross!|Well, let's go grab it before he hits the ground, which is when I assume he'll take a bite.
 Yeah, okay.|Hmm.  Feels like cold spaghetti. 
 Hmm.  Feels like cold spaghetti. | Oh... hey, Jake.
  How long have we been in here?| I don't know.
  Retreat!|Whoa, how long were we in there?
 | BMO!
 I agree that is when he will probably take a bite.|You're not helping.
 Yes!|Alright, BMO!
 Alright, BMO!|Wait, wait, wait. BMO, are you just making a skateboard video?
 He lied to me.|Relax.  I'm calling Princess Bubblegum. It's ringing.
  Maybe I should just make another one.   Eh, okay. Let's do this. I can make another awesome sandwich. Creation realm, inspire me once again!   Okay.|Thanks again for coming, Prubbles.
 Of course, Finn. Once you explained about Jake's sandwich, I had to. |So, how's it looking?
 I'm picking up major levels here.|Of magic?
 Molasses.|Oh.
 Well, I'm out of ideas. |Who ya calling?
 Marceline.|The vampire queen?!
 Yeah, Marceline's got a great plan.|Yeah, man!
 ...iiiiiiiii...|Hey, man. What are you doing?
 I'm lighting these candles so I can move on with the grieving process. I made them with the leftover bacon fat from my sand—|I am not giving up.  Let's see. Who should I call? Ice King? Shelby? Tree Trunks?
 Tree Trunks?! No, man, don't call Tree Trunks! What's she gonna do, bake an apple pie?! Don't you get it?! It's over. It's over, and I've never been so sad. And you know what? I got to deal with it. |Jake, look!
 Hmm? What? But how?|Because you've never been this sad! That's what Magic Man meant by your face showing 7
 What?! Nobody  calls it that.|Nope! No! Don't get judgmental.
 Right.   Magic Man, I'm gonna sock you in the head!   |Jake, every time you get happy, you slow down! Stay sad, man! Make yourself sad!
 Hey, Mr. Cupcake, you stay away  from Lady!|No, man! Stay sad! Make yourself sad!
  Me, too!  |Yeah, Jake! The wetter, the better! Keep crying!
 Heh. My vault feels lighter.|Wha—?
 Wha—?|Wha—?!
 I'm coming! |She's got me! She's got me!
  Yo, bro, you're sleepwalking again! Wake up! |Whoa. Jake? Was I...?
" Yes, Finn. Again. Every time youse is screaming about ""She's got me!"" and all that."|She's got... Wha?
 That's too much; don't punch yourself.|Eh, it's gone. I don't know.
   You're repressin' the memory, dude!|I'm what?
 You're hiding whatever she is in a mental vault.|Oh, yeah. The vault. That's where the stuff I can't handle goes. Kerplunk.
 Okay, so you even know you're doing it? |Yeah. 
 Listen, we gotta find out who this lady is. We gotta open the vault a little.|No, sir.
 This is just gonna keep happening, man.|It's alright. I'm not hurting anybody.
 Finn, for reals.| NO!
 Alright. Chill, chill. Don't sweat it, man. It's not even a thing.|Cool.
 Why don't you clean up the kitchen now?|Okay. I'm sorry I did that.
 Wow, that was fast.|Yup.
 While you were doing that, I downloaded a new game on BMO.|There's a cricket in here.
  Huh?|What is it?
 I don't know. Lady said it's good.|Hmmm. She likes those games where you're, like, collecting materials to make stationery.
 Naw, this is different.  It's different.|A'ight, let's peep it.
 Regression Simulator? Uh, okay.|Start.
 Welcome, adventurer.|Whoa.
  Deep into your subconscious mind. Follow me now, adventurer.|  The vault.
 What do you see?|I see... my past lives.
 I see... my past lives.|I was a comet...
 I was a comet...| A butterfly...
  A butterfly...| A thing... I don't know what that is. Some kind of shape? Or a doodoo in another dimension?
 Do you remember anything about the scary lady?|Scary lady?
 Scary lady?|Yeah. I was her! Except she was a chubby tiger.
 Yeah. I was her! Except she was a chubby tiger.|No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. She was riding a tiger, and she wasn't scary.
 How you doin', buddy?|The past was to be reckoned with.
 Ahhh... look at that. I got a new arm. That would be cool if I weren't about hit my reset button...|Hey, hey. This way.
 What was th—aww, no.  Dog-drangit, Finn...|Okay, here you go.
 Whoa, what?! My amulet?! Wait a second...  Is that...?|It's me, Shoko! And PB, you're like a bazillion years old. You're not freaking nineteen! What the heck?!
 It's me, Shoko! And PB, you're like a bazillion years old. You're not freaking nineteen! What the heck?!|Weirdo.
 Weirdo.|Heh. My vault feels lighter.
 Okay, welcome back to the program. We're talkin' with our special guest, Finn the Human.|Hello.
 Now, Finn, before the break, you were sayin' somethin' interesting—that you're gettin' outta the romance biz. So, what happened?|Well, I don't want to bore your listeners...
 Well, I don't want to bore your listeners...|But let's just say the time has come to stop dating princesses... and return to savin' 'em.
 And you're not just sayin' that to, uh—  make yourself seem more attractive?|Yeah, of course. No games goin' on here.
 So, it's goin' pretty good, huh?|"Yeah, but maybe we should stop talking about this ""love"" junk and get back to adventuring."
 Finn! Jake! I need your help; it's an emergency! |Now we're talkin'! Don't cry, Slime Princess. We're at your service.
 I need Finn to marry me.|I'm sorry, SP, but I've given up the dating scene.
 Finn, this will happen unless someone marries me.|No.
 Please, Finn. I know I've crushed on you in the past, but I have no intention of locking this down. Our marriage will be in name only.|Hmmm...
" Oasis? More like, ""No way, sis!"" "|Huh?
  |Whoa! This is amazing! You okay, buddy?
 Quickly. We're already late.  This is the most important place in the kingdom.|The royal palace?
 Hi!|Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig, what are you doing here?
  Order, order! I demand order. I, Elder Plops, being the coolest guy in the room, will settle this dispute. The matter will be settled on the battleground...|Alright!
 ...the battleground of love.|Aw.
 The couple that I deem most truly in love shall rule the Slime Kingdom for life.  Plops out. |
 Okay, Finn, you can do it.|I don't know. I'm still jacked up over my lady biz.
 Well, just lose yourself in your own mind and go numb. Then let it all out.|Eh.  Okay. Just let it all out.  Why can't I get over you?
 |Whoo!
 Welcome, everyone, to our second trial...  Spooning. When I say go, the big spoon will put his arm around the little spoon and cuddle. I will be watching you spoon, measuring and assessing your love by posture and overall vibe. The best cuddle, or spoon, wins.|Wait, what?!
 Spooners, get in your futons.|Uh, I don't feel good about this.
 Spoon!| No, wait. I don't wanna do this.
 Wrap those gorgeous pythons around me!|No! This feels weird!
 Blargetha and Guillermo, very nice.|Nooooooooooooooooo!
 Yes! I love you, baby. You spoon so good!|
  This is not going well.|I'm sorry, Slime Princess. I'm just gonna mess this next trial up.
 Is it because you haven't done much kissing? You don't have to be embarrassed by your innocence.|Pretending to be in love is making me sad. It makes me think about Flame Princess.
 What If I pretend to be your ex?|That's worse, I think.
 Well, it looks like I'm losing my kingdom to the forces of evil.| No, Slime Princess. Let's practice this smooch. 
  Mmmm.|  I'm sorry. I—I can't!   Bunk this.
 Wait! Where are you going?|I'm going to punch Guillermo in his stupid face until he agrees to leave the kingdom.
 I want to come!|Hey, Guillermo! Can you come out here for a... quick meeting?
 Blargetha!| Hyup!  Hmm. 
 Finn, you shouldn't break in to a woman's room.|Hyah! Everyone okay?
" Yes. ""Tank"" you."|Huah! 
 Huh?|Guillermo!  Hyuh!  Are you dead, man? Aw, jeez, bro.  Huh? These are olives.
 You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you, because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you, because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives in a glob of gelatin and called it my lover.|Well, I'm sorry, Blargetha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison 'cause what you're doing is illegal.
 Uh, no, it just disqualifies her from challenging me.|Whoops.
 Finn, what do you think?|I don't want to disappoint all these people.
 Yeah, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. That... is what I'm talkin' about.|"What... is the meaning of ""soup""?"
 What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest—?|"What... is the meaning of ""spoon""?"
 Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about Flame Princess? Y'know, it's okay if you are.|Naw, that's all fine. I just been feeling kind of... gray, is all. Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately. Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y'know?
 Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, Finn, girls is like horses. When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again—on a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea. A lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned.|Yeah, I-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle.
 Yeah, man, yeah!|Or, like, if you mess up, you could get really hurt forever, or hurt someone you really care about.
 What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way!|Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really.
 Gimme! Gimme the loot! |Ow!
 Ow!|Yeeow!
 Gimme! Gimme that hat! |Knock it off! 
 Oh, dang!|
 Hey, Finn!|Whoa!
 Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt!|Dang, look at that sword!  Whoa. Feels kinda right.  Whoosh. Whoosh. Vvsh, vvsh.   Whoa!
  Pretty fun, huh?|Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun!
 You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train?|Yes! 
  |Whoa, Crystal Ants, I think! 
  Cool!  |Ha-ha! Yeah!  Die, die, die, die, die, die, die! 
   Welcome back, buddy.|Man, look at all this rad loot!
 Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday.|Whoa, what do you mean? We just started only, like, three hours ago.
 Heheh, yeah. I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all. All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same. It's a little boring.|Oh, come on.  It's fun! Just one more car. Come on.  Come on, man!  Come on!
 All right, just one more.|Ha-ha, yes!
 |Hmm? Where is everybody?
 Hey, hey! Empty car—think we beat it, buddy.|Whoa, man! Boss battle! Let's chew it up! 
 Okay, but this is the last one, okay?|We'll see!
 We'll see!|Ha-ha!
 Hey, man,  you remember we were going to that weird cave? Bet it's not too late to check it out.| Eh, weird cave, weird train—I'm cool here.
  Okay.|Hyah! 
 Ahhhh, gimme a break!|Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot!  Oh, yeah. 
 No, thank you.|Jake, hurry. Next car!
 Jake, hurry. Next car!|Slime crimes! 
 You have fun. I'm just gonna watch. | Hey.
  Hey.|Ow!  Ow. Cool... acid!
 Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry?|Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while.
 More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window!|Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break.
 And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or—| Look.  Now we don't gotta do that thing you wanted to do. 
  Aah!|Hot meat!
 Ants again? |"""Ant"" no thang!  Yah!  Caught with your ""ants"" down! ""Ants"" for nothin'!  Forget about ""ant""!  What's wrong? Feeling antsy? "
  Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. We did all the ants!|Same car,  but those were blue ants. These are red ants.
 Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you.|"Man, no way. All this feels good.  Like my inside voice is saying, ""Hey, keep it up. This is good stuff.""  Aah! Hey!  Ah! Like when you made those biscuits way back? And I kept eating them until they were all gone. Like that!"
 Finn,  I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter!|Yeah! 
 Yeah! |Boss fight! 
 Boss fight! | 
 My jacket-sta! | Check it out
"  Get ""ant"" of town."|Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life!
 Nuh-uh, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house.  You can come with me if you want.|What? No, man! It's better on the train; stuff makes sense here.
  |Yow!  
 I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair.|You'll be back.
 No, I won't, Finn.  Goodbye!|
 |"Hey!   ""Hair"" we go!"
  Gotta find that kid. Hey, Finn!  Fi—oh!  Umm... hey, there, friend. I ain't lookin' for no trouble. Just lookin' for my friend, Finn. Maybe you seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l—|Hey, hey! Jake, it's me!  I'm just all souped up now.
 Ah, jeez, Finn. I... for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys.| Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl.
 Wait, you are! You are one!|What? Those guys are cool!
 That's it, man! I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not! |Jake, stay back. I mean it!
 Oh, please. What're you gonna do? I'm ten times stronger than—|
 Ah, gross! | Yoink!   Pff, Jake—tryin' to tell me what to do. Pff, yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now let's see what we got here.  Apple, apple, chicken, apple...  Oh, yeah, that little orb in which I rule! Let's see that again, orb.  Yeah, that's right. Lookin' right.  Wait a second, who's that sad ward little guy followin' me around?  Jake? All those years—he stayed with me.
 What?|Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'ma set this right.
 Finn? Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you, I swear. Just get this stuff off of me.| No, I'm sorry, Jake. I messed up, but don't worry. It's all over now.
 You mean we're gettin' off the train?|Well... you are. I'm gonna keep playin' for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two.
 Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'? It's got its hooks in you! | No, no for real!  My inside is tellin' me it's time. Here,  see for yourself.
 Nachos?|Nachos? I love nachos...  I love nachos even more when looking out of the window! 
 Nachos? I love nachos...  I love nachos even more when looking out of the window! |Hmmm, does that box have a face on it? A face... I gotta make sure.
 Hmmm, does that box have a face on it? A face... I gotta make sure.| There's a box outside with a face on it! It might be the boxman, it's all soggy and dirty. Want to check it out?
 Naaaaa... chos.| I'm gonna check it out.
 Yeah, whatever.|Hmmm, where'd your face go? 
 Hmmm, where'd your face go? |Whoa! Okay... shhh... are you lost, little cardboard dude?
 Whoa! Okay... shhh... are you lost, little cardboard dude?|Jake! There seems to be a lost cat on the ground in a box!
 Yeah that's great, get it out of here!|Hm, gettin' no help from him I guess. Do you know where your home is?
 Hm, gettin' no help from him I guess. Do you know where your home is?|Okay, I'll follow you!
 Okay, I'll follow you!|Whoa, is this your kingdom? It's wonderful!
 Whoa, is this your kingdom? It's wonderful!|That must be your prince.
 |Huh?
 Huh?|Huh... a prince wouldn't steal from his subjects.  Awww!
 |Switched?  Of course! You must be the real prince, and that thief took your place! Is that right, little prince?
 | Don't worry, your majesty. I'll help you reclaim your kingdom. 
 Eugh... no! I'm pretty dang far from okay! There's a little shard of Tortilla chip caught between my teeth. |First, we have to expose the traitor's deception. Ah-hah! That's a counterfeit crown, from the liar's own box flesh. Hmm... it looks like your crown was torn off by some... 
  Mew.|Your crown was lost, you say?
 |During a storm? The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods? Until you were delivered into my door step? Right... so it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince.
 During a storm? The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods? Until you were delivered into my door step? Right... so it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince.| Um... I'm gonna wait over by the gate, your highness.
 If you get everything you want the minute you want it, then what's the point of livin'?|Okay, so let's retrace your steps. Do you remember which path you took? ... Prince?
 Okay, so let's retrace your steps. Do you remember which path you took? ... Prince?|Whoa, you found it already! Good work, team. 
 Whoa, you found it already! Good work, team. |Ow, quit that!  Come on, you're a prince.  Come, your majesty. It's time...
 Ow, quit that!  Come on, you're a prince.  Come, your majesty. It's time...| People of the Box Kingdom, I have found...  your true prince!  J'accuse!
  People of the Box Kingdom, I have found...  your true prince!  J'accuse!|What? They... they don't believe us. The rain made your complexion look all hobo-like. They're not looking past the surface grunk.
 What? They... they don't believe us. The rain made your complexion look all hobo-like. They're not looking past the surface grunk.|Oh no, he's challenging you to a joust! I better find you a lance.
 Just the edge, kid, then I'll work it like a pro. Now, to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality.|Trial by combat shall prove which prince's true!
 Trial by combat shall prove which prince's true!|The joust's gone nuts!
 ZIP IT!| Bad! Bad princes!
  Bad! Bad princes!|Which is which...?
 |Awwww!  This is the one! This is your prince!
 | Or maybe this is the one!
  Or maybe this is the one!|Hmmm, is this... is this even a kingdom?
 Hmmm, is this... is this even a kingdom?|Haha! Hey! Ow, you guys... aw, come on!
 |What's wrong with you, man?
 I ate all the candy in your backpack, and now I'm sick.|I didn't bring any candy.
 Oh, no. That explains why it didn't taste right.|Nothing tastes right today. Like, I thought we were going to get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish.
 That's how I feel—like a dying parsley. So what's goin' on with the spoon? Marceline and the spoon.|Um...  nothing.  Wait, there she goes!
  Yo, wake up, sand dude.  I think they're dead.  A spoon.| Yea-uh. The Spoon of Prosperity!
 Oh, my gosh, I feel so much better! Hungry, even. Guys, let's go home!|We've gotta get this spoon to Princess Bubblegum first.
 What's PB want with that spoon, anyway?|Beats me.
 Yeah!   Heh. Quicksand is pretty fun. Heh.|Quit messing around, Jake.
 Okie-doke.|Whoa!
 Uh, give me a pull, please.   Stop, you guys are tickling me! Let me try this other thing.  Flesh drill!|I'm not sure that's a good idea—
 Aah!  Whoo! It worked! Jake drill worked, you guys.|Whoa!
 Yeah, only half.|You also sealed our exit.
 No!|You'll bury us alive!
 Undead!| Finn to PB. Come in, PB.
 Oh, hi, Finn.|Princess, we're trapped in the underground city.
 Yeah-yeah. That sounds great.|Huh? No, we need help!
 That's great!  Gre-gre-great! Great, great!| Guess we lost the signal. 
 Oooh. I'm sorry!|Calm down, Marceline. There's gotta be some red stuff in these ruins. I'll go explore. You guys hang out here and save your energy.
 Thanks, Finn.| Be cool.
   Hurry, Finn.|Red, red, red. I guess even a vampire queen's face would melt off if she tried to eat lava.
  Why did you leave me here, dude? |Okay, here we go. Yeah, look at that!  Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm.  Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wisemen-zerts . Oh, well. Gotta feed the Marcy monster.  'Scuse me. Up, sorry. Okay. Uhh... hi-yah!  Oh, dag.
 Okay, here we go. Yeah, look at that!  Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm.  Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wisemen-zerts . Oh, well. Gotta feed the Marcy monster.  'Scuse me. Up, sorry. Okay. Uhh... hi-yah!  Oh, dag.|Cool... What the heck happened here?  Whoop!  Ew. Whoops. Y'alls got turned into sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this.  Around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm...  Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right?
 Cool... What the heck happened here?  Whoop!  Ew. Whoops. Y'alls got turned into sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this.  Around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm...  Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right?|Okay. I was just making sure.  Bet that guy was a creep.  This hole is deep.
 |Maybe I should go back. Well, I've already gone this far.  Shebang! That oughtta be enough red to un...  Oops.
 Paris? Is that you?|You mean the guy with the big thing on his head?
 Yes. Have you returned to complete the plan?|Naw. Paris is, like, super dead.
 What?! No! How long?|Dude, like, a really long time. Like five hundred years.
  Five hundred— Chum! I must've zoned out!|What the heck were you two doing?
 Once we turned the city to sand, we were gonna reanimate their bodies and conquer my homeland at the center of the planet.|Hm, that's dumb.
 Time to go back home a true loser.|Can I have this big ol' ruby, then?
 That's an emerald.|Clearly it's a big ol' ruby.
 I don't know what to tell you, man.|I would like the ruby.
 It's yours, buddy.  I'm outties. ]|Peace. Hyup!    Whoops.
  |  
 Finn!| Bleh. The trick is rollin' it. Phew! Check out this ruby I got.
 That's an emerald, dude.|You too now?! Emeralds are green, boyee.
 This thing is green.|Why is everybody messin' with me? It's like a dark gray-ish red. Mostly gray. Sometimes red things are gray!
 You're a little colorblind... and there's nothin' to be ashamed of!|Oh... whoops.
 I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far.|Uh, what's goin' on with Marcy?
 I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What?  |Chill, man!
  Go where, Jake?  I gotta suck out your insides first, right?|Nay-nay, brah!
 Time to eat!  Huh? What the—?|Bubblegum?
  Woof. Thanks, Bonnie. That's enough low-grade red to get me home, at least. Come on, guys. Let's go.|Are you alright, PB?
  Did you get the Spoon of Prosperity?| Yeah, here you go. 
 Whoa!  Where did ya get this baby? |"I found it in the woods. I named it ""Hot Daniel."" Anyway, I figured we could do some pretty sick stuff with it."
 Oh, yeah? Like what?|Hmm. I don't know. Launch it off some ramps, maybe get it going thirty miles per hour, crank the wheel into a gnar right-hander, spray dirt everywhere like a big hurkin' dirt wave?
 Yeah, buddy!  Nice! Let's crank this beast up.|Can't—engine's busted, I think.
 Nope.|Hmm. Maybe...  Ice King, you know anything about cars?
 Other|Hmm.
 Wow! I haven't seen you fellas since you destroyed my home, my land, and my rocket.|Aw, jeez, yeah. Sorry, Banana Man—just sorta happened.
  I see the problem. The top of your engine is gone, specifically, the cylinder head.|Hm. Okay. That word sounds cool... but what does it mean?
 Let me explain.  The cylinder head is the top to the cylinder block.  Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust.|Okay. Cool. Informative.  What is he pointing at?
 Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine. |Sweet. So where's the cylinder head, then?
 Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they're working on in the car.  Ah! Bingo!  Found it.|Yeah! Drive time!
 Well... n-not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off. Uh, it could be cracked, the gasket head could be warped, the rod bearings could have damage from water—you see, that's the cool thing about cars.  One tiny little thing messes everything else up so nothing works! So it's up to us to figure it out!|Cool.
 Whoo. I'm bushed. You guys wanna pick this up again in the mornin'?|Sure.
 Not BMO. This grease monkey's torqued up on automotive styles.  Yeah,  boyee!|Okay, BMO. Good night, Banana Man.
 Hold up. Princess? Is that you?  Ah, spooky.|Yo, BMO. Coffee.
 Thank you. |Car looks nice, BMO.
   Uh! Ah! I fixed it! Are we best friends yet?! Oh. Oh, hey. I-I fixed it.| N-i-i-i-i-i-ice.
 I discovered the cylinder head was warped so I went to the junkyard and got a new one.  Bingo.|Whoo.
 Yeah!|Awesome!
 He-e-e-elp m-e-e-e-e-e-e!|We gotta save Bubblegum!
 You gotta stop listening to all those conspiracy shows.  They twist up your noodle so you can't tell what's real.|Look, there she is!
 Thanks, Jake.|So, what's up with the angry mob, PB?
  | Punch it, 'Nana Man!
 Finn, Jake! Reptilian synthoid replicants are trying to take over the kingdom!|Yeah. We know.
  Loot, bro!|Gear dumped, bro!  How about this room, bro?
  Looks like a brolicious room to relax in and play video games... bro.|Home, sweet home, bro.
   I keep forgetting that he lives here now.| Just until Gunter finishes rebuilding the Ice Kingdom.
 Other| It's not that bad, Jake.
 Other| Look, I hear you. But we can't kick him out because I still feel guilty about junking up his crib. Hey, what if we check him into a hotel room?
 Hmmm? |What's that?
 Other|Hey, Simon, how would you like to stay in the Coolest Hotel?
 Lumpy Space Princess stays there. That's how cool it is.|We'll even put you up for few weeks until your place is ready.
 Other|Hehe, yeah?
 Finn, I'm ready to murder the Ice King.|No. I-I have another idea.
 Other|Oh, my gosh! Someone's at the door. We have a doorbell now. We'll get it.
 Abracadaniel?!|What are you doing here? 
 Hahaha! Shut up-up-up-up-up, Abracadeez!|Yeah, man! You don't even need a reason to stop by! 
 Other| Come on, dude, we got cookies and the cocoa!   Dang! But you're funny, Abracadaniel!
 I didn't say anything.| Fantastic.
" Oh? Uhh. Yeah! I suppose I could!  ""Shirmo lock kanta Floriana"" "|So good! Whoo!
  This was a great idea, man! It's like he's forgotten all about us!|Uhh-huh. Pretty soon, he'll be outta here for good.
 For good!| Yeah!
 Other|Ice King? What's up?  Huh? What the flip?
 You pushed my whole body!|Um,  whoo! That was great, guys!
 Other|Uh,  actually, Jake and I have got, uh, got some stuff to take care of.
 Uh... oh, Glob.|'Sup, ABD?
 I just remember that I'm, uh, a-allergic, uh, to, to the night sky.|You're afraid of the dark?
 Of fright!|Gee. Well, I guess you can crash here for the night.
  Sleepover!!|Wait! Are you really afraid of the dark?
 Maybe.|Okay. Well, you can sleep on the couch. We're gonna go. Uh, good night. 
 Kee Oth Rama P... |Dude!!
 I'm not bluffing, Joshua! If you do not willingly return my stolen blood, I will destroy him  and him. |Ahh! The sword!
 Scary!|I just can't do it, Jake. This is Dad's sword!
 Do it!!|Whoa.
 Whoa.|You got your blood, now get outta here!
 Other|Jake?
 Okay.|Jake?  Drat! Hmmmmmmm.  Ah! 
  여보세요? (Hello?)|Hey, Lady. Listen. Your husband got abducted by Kee-Oth the demon.
  누구? Jake? (Who are you talking about? Jake?)|Yeah, your hubby - your boyfriend or whatever.
  어머, 뭔 소리야! 걔 내 남자친구잖아! 왜 자꾸 우리 사이를 이상한 쪽으로 몰고 가려고 그래? (Oh, what are you talking about! He's my boyfriend! Why are you keep assuming my relationship between Jake weirdly!)|Yo, my Korean is not that good. Can you just get over here? We need to find a way to Kee-Oth's dimension 십시요..
   아! 맞아. 내가 도움 될 만한 거 가지고 있어! (Oh, right! I got something that can be helpful!)|Alright. That sounds...affirmative. See you soon. Bye. 
  Hello?  I'm just gonna pretend you're sleeping. | Whoop! She's here.
 가지고 왔어! (I've got it!)|What is it, Lady?
  옛날에 조슈아가 만든 테잎이야. 제이크가 그 위에 그냥 녹음해버려서 기억하고 있어. 그 앞쪽은 보지 말고 그냥 빨리 돌려! (It's a video tape that was made by Joshua long ago. I remembered it because Jake recorded something else on top of it. Just skip past the front section!)|What?
  앞쪽 보지 말고 그냥 빨리 달.. 돌리라구. (Just skip the front section of the tape.)|Eh, something skip? I don't know. Just play it, BMO.
  Jake? Finn? Jermaine? Whoever is watching this?|Dad!
  돌려! 돌려!! (Skip!! Skip!!!)|BMO! Skip!  Skip!!
  ...saying JTD won't change his doggy ways.| That should be good.
 No!|Hold on, BMO, I feel like we should watch more of this video for clues, but you gotta promise me that I'm not going to see more weird Jake stuff.
  더이상 제이크가 이상한 짓 하는 거 없을 거야. 진짜야! 그래도 내가 이 테잎 본 지 하도 오래 돼서 장담은 못 하겠네. 미안해. (I don't think there's any more weird Jake stuff.  Really!  But I can't promise anything, as I haven't seen this tape for years! Sorry for that.)|Okay, high-five! Play it, BMO!
  Release me, Joshua!  I'll show you!|"Dude, your blood is harsh!
Joshua"
 Hey, dude.|You still thinking about...
 Yeah.|Yeah? Me, too. Princess Bubblegum's ready for us, so we should go.
 Okay. Just give me a few more months in here and I'll be ready.|It's okay, man. Just—just play it off. Just make a—a normal face.  See? Normal face.
  |
 |Heh. Dude, James is kind of, uh, goofy.
 Ugh! |Ugh! Everyone okay?
  |Huh?  Oh, my garf! What are they?!
 Those goo monsters will barf their way through the hull in mere minutes. Finn, what should we do?| Uh... let's radio for help.
 Mnh. Mnh. James, that's not helping!|Don't panic, baby.
  Lucky coin strikes again!|Hey, Preebos, I know things seem bad, but I'll figure out a plan.
 James, the radio's still not working! I'm not getting any signal.| What the skunk?!
  What the skunk?!|James, it's all sanched up!
 He did his best, you guys.|Right, right. Okay, time for plan B. James, pass me them flares.
 Chk-oo! Boop! A flare for m'liege.| James, where are the flares?!
  Finn, PB, can I speak to you in the other room, please?!|You want to do this trust-huddle style, buddy?
 What's up with that James dude?|Yeah. Do you think James could be breaking things on purpose?
 What's not James?  I got lonely up front. I wanted to see what y'all are up to.|Hey, that gives me an idea.
 You see anything, brudda?| Ah, I got bunkus. Wait. If we jam up to that cliff face, I think we can climb—whoop.  More goo bros.
  Ah, I got bunkus. Wait. If we jam up to that cliff face, I think we can climb—whoop.  More goo bros.|What the—?!
 Yeah, man. It always keeps me calm.| Who shot that flare, James?
 We don't have time to point fingers.| You're right. There's only one way out of this jam. One of us has to eat the big one so the others can survive.
  You're right. There's only one way out of this jam. One of us has to eat the big one so the others can survive.|And I'm gonna be that one. I'll run up there and get the creatures to chase me, and while they're busy noshing on my teen-boy body, you three can climb to safety. Don't try to talk me out of it. I got crystal certainty. This is what it means to be a he—
 Sure thing, Princess!  Byong!|Ugh! Huh? Why did—Jake?
 |Wh—where's James? 
 Wh—where's James? |James! 
 James! | Aah! James, look out! Ohh. PB! What's going on?
 Finn, I need to explain something really heavy. I was the one who sabotaged all your escape plans. I calculated the chance of success for every possible escape plan, and none of them were going to work. You said it yourself|But I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?
 There's a reason. With this sample of James, I can clone a new one. He's candy, but you're not. I can't clone another you.|Whoa.
 |Is this right or wrong? I can't tell.
 It's all about the leads.|See? I told you, it's candy stucco. Stucco feels great.
 Um, we were at home last night.|Yeah, we were doing that... thing.
 That was a great thing we were doing at home with no other witnesses.|But we're each other's witnesses.
 But I saw you.| Look, man, you didn't see nothing.
 Finn and Jake?|Well, guys. It looks like you caught us.
 Well, guys. It looks like you caught us.|Okay, Princess, you can come out now.
 As Ooo's greatest champion, I'm relying on you to keep Lumpy Space Princess from crashing this wedding. I went ahead and deputized you.  So, you know, no holds barred, got it?| Yeah. Oh, what about Jake?
 Shh...|Sounds really sweet.
 Sounds really sweet.|Lumpy Space Princess? Is that you?
 Let me go to this party...|It's not your party, LSP. 
 Princess Bubblegum, you have gone too far. We stand together against your tyranny.|Hey, everybody.
  Do it again! |Thanks, bro!
 There for you, bro... but Finn, I'm gonna tell you something gently.| Okay. What is it, bro?
 Get a new sword.|What you do mean?
 Bro, these guys could've hurt you.|It still works.  Hyut!
 Bro...|I love this sword. 
 Hey! There's Choose Goose!  Goose! Come on!  Finn? What's wrong?|Mm, maybe we should try someone else.
 What? But we have history with him—that's important in business.|Yeah, but we're lookin' for a sword. Remember that armor he sold us? 
 I asked around. This is the place to get sa-words. |Oh. Doesn't look like it's open.
 How can I help you?|Need a sword.
 Hold on.  Here you go|I don't know. I've never used a grass sword before. Maybe we should keep lookin'.
 Swords like this don't come around every day.|Don't come around every day, uh?  I love it.
 Hey, the pillow vendor!|Huh? Hyut! 
 Huh? Pizza?!|Yeah! Came outta nowhere! It was gonna bonk you on the head.
 You're getting good with that sword. You were never able to do that with your other swords.|No more pizza bonks. Hyut!  Hey, we're near Tree Trunks' house. Let's stop by and get some pie.
 Pie!| Hyut! Hyut!
  Hyut! Hyut!|Hyaaaah!♪
 Howdy, boys! Nice pillow and nice sword. My hands are full, Finn. Uh, you mind slicin' an apple for me? |Hyut! 
 Uh, how's that curse doin'? Makin' you want to moidle me? |No, man. This sword doesn't seem to have any curse on it, as far as I can tell.  Hyah!
 Well, okay.  Dang tag.|I got it!
 |Whoa!
 Hey, quit showin' off, bro!|Sorry, man. I don't know what happened. I-I... I'll go put this away.
 Good idea. |  Huh? 
   Huh? |What the—? 
 What the—? | Jeez.
  Jeez.|Stupid...  thing!  Worst three bucks I've ever spent.
 Stupid...  thing!  Worst three bucks I've ever spent.|  Whew.
   Whew.|
 What's goin' on?|The sword is after my flesh!
 Oh, snap!|Don't let it get me, Jake!
 Don't worry. I'll handle this.  There.| Let's go return that junk.
 Huh. Hey, he's not here.|Hmm. Maybe someone around here knows where he is.
 Hmm. Maybe someone around here knows where he is.|Somebody in trouble!
 It's the Hooligans Who Love Candles!|Let's get 'em!  Hey!
 Yo! You got a prob, Bob?|Stealing candles from old ladies is immoral!  
 Anarchy! | School!  Hyah!
  You're dead, teddy boy.|No.
 Dude... |Yeah... not comin' off.
 Hmm.|I made a mistake, CG. This merch is totally defective.  Please.
 Awesome. Wizard of Grassy Moun-tayn... Mountain. Yeah, thanks, Choogs.|Yeah, thanks!
 He's a huge ding-wad—just the worst.|Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!
 |Hmm. For a cursed dingus, you cut so good.
 Hmm. For a cursed dingus, you cut so good.|Come forth, wizard, and uncurse my mitt! Grassy Mountain Wizard!
 Comin' up here tryin' to enter my house! Are you for real?!  Mow 'em down, my cursed grassy objects! |Hyah! 
 Uh... go forth! Go... uh, forth.  That was all my grassy objects.| Lift the curse.
  Never! You have no power over me, young fool! The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity! | Hmm. You know what?  I think I'm cool with that.
 What?|Whoa.  
 Now that you've accepted it, you can control it!| Yeah.  This is really cool!  I just had to get used to it. 
  |Good morning, Princess!
  Finn! You scared me!|I am sorry, Princess!
 What are you doing here, Finn?|Since I got out of my last relationship, I've been slackin' on the job. So I'm rededicating my life to protecting, serving, and meeting your every need. Jake said I was acting bananas about the whole thing and wanted no part of this.
 It's 5|That's right, Princess. I'm gettin' back on the job hardcore, giving 100% of my being all for you.
 Thank you, that's very nice. |No need to thank me, PB. It's my job.
 No need to thank me, PB. It's my job.|Heh.
 Thank you. | How am I doin' my job, Princess? Am I crushin' it?
 No, no, like, out of the way.|Oh! 
 Okay, what else do I need? Aw, dangit, I forgot we're out of milk. Now I have to go get it from—| Buh-buh-buh! I got it!  Hyah!
  Buh-buh-buh! I got it!  Hyah!|Milk... You wanted milk...
 Finn, I thought you went home.|Yes, I do regret the slow return, but I assure you, this is the highest quality milk available. It's mink's milk. I milked a mink. 100% dedication, no limits for what I do for you. I'd throw Peppermint Butler off this balcony if you ask.  Sorry, Peppermint Butler, just joking, but kinda sorta not.
  You're really going over the top here. Take it easy. Princess's orders.|Okay, I'll just rest here.
 No, no, resting on the job is not resting. Go somewhere where you can relax!|Yes, Princess. 
 Yes, Princess. | Princess, I give my life to you girl, you are the best dang princess in the whole wide world.  Wow, PB, sure is a nice day to be outside!  Hey, watch what you say about PB, bro. Talk garbage about PB one more time, bro. See what happens!  Hold on one sec, PB. I gotta deal with a real tough guy over here.  You got one last chance to apologize before I dishonor you like you did my lady! Alright, bro, have it your way! Yah!  Where's your pants bro? Where's your honor now? Everyone's laughing at your undies! It's real uncomfortable! Wants some!  Wowzers!  No!  Did you drop this car on my lady, bro?!
 Leave this dump now! |You dropped a car on my lady, bro. Now I gotta restore her honor. I hope you're wearing underwear.  Whoa, dude's got awesome powers.  Hey, dude, you got awesome powers!  You gonna kill me, bro?
 No. Instead, I will pluck out your eyes with the point of my sword, and whenever you try to see stuff, you will think only of me, Rattleballs! |Do it! I ain't a baby!  Do it, bro! 
 You have a warrior's spirit!  Something I haven't seen in a long time. But your swordsmanship is . You should learn to master your weapon before you draw it. |What?! You're just gonna tell me I'm terrible and walk away? Teach me sword stuff, man! 
 I know you're back there.|I brought you a muffin.
 I don't eat muffins; I'm a robot. |Look, I know you don't know me and we got off on the wrong foot, but please, dude, teach me how to use the sword. Please!  You okay?
 No. When I was a young robot, I went horseback riding. No one taught me how to post. The horse took a crazy jump, and I came down on the saddle hard. One of my gumballs bounced up inside me. It's been lodged in a weird spot for years.|Oh, here. 
 More to the left! Getting closer. Closer!  You got it!  Thank you!|Yeah, perhaps you feel a sense of indebted obligation to me?
 Lesson one|Yut!  Ha, got one!
 You have done well today! You have felt the sting of the yolk, endured the sizzle of the mini-BBQ. Perhaps you are ready to learn my secret technique.|Secret technique!
 Watch! |What the—?! 
 The shadowless thrust. Your blade must be swift enough to slice the air between you and the target, removing all wind resistance.  Now you try.  Again. |So, am I a master swordsman now? 
 You will be if you train this hard every day... for ten years... and get a robot body.|Oh. So, uh, why you livin' in this dump? You should be out in the world, saving fancy ladies and junk.
 I alone escaped, while my compatriots became minimalist furniture. |Oh, sorry! 
 Rattleballs is still what?!|He asked me not to tell you, but I cannot break my oath to serve you, my lady, 100%.
 Hello, Princess.|Sorry Ree-B-Z. My oath to the princess comes first, but once you two talk it out, I know she'll see you mean no harm.
 So be it! |Wait! 
 Rattleballs! |RB, don't!
 Dang right I do! You killed all my banana guards!|No, Princess, look! They're only bruised!
 Mmm, okay.|Waah!
 Finn!|Um...  hey. Uh, Jake isn't here. He's sleeping over at Lady Rainicorn's maybe.
 Finn, I've been slowly poisoned by my treacherous handmaiden. Now my powers are weakened, and—and the Flame Lord has freed my father and threatened to marry me. But I escaped with CB.|Oh, what?! I'll help you. I'll do anything for you.
 Listen, Finn, this doesn't mean we're getting back together. We're all business.|Mm-hmm. Of course.
  I'm feeling exhausted. Where can I freshen up?| Girls' bathroom is over there. Also, it's the boys' bathroom.
 Oh, thanks. |So, what do you think, CB? You think I still have a shot with her, right?
  No.|Does she ever talk about me? Is she seeing anybody?
 No and no.|"""No and no,"" she does talk about me, or ""no and no,"" she isn't seeing anybody?"
 Alright, guys, let's wolf.|So... your Fire Wolf can fly.
 Yep. I taught him.|Hmm.  Whoa! You've cooled down a lot.
 No funny stuff.|Things have been going great for me lately. Been hanging out with my boys. I got a cursed sword arm now, so that's new. Yeah, I've been exercising a lot and taking some piano lessons—trying to improve myself. Not dating anybody or anything, just getting a little me time, being the best Finn I can be. 
  Hyup! |Oh, no!
 Oh, no!|I hid my flameproof suit behind these rocks... just in case, whatever, you know?
  So, the guards are posted here and here, so we should probably sneak in here. |Suited! 
 Uh...|Remember my fire suit? Hey, CB, you did a great job getting us here and everything,  but I got this, all right?
 Remember my fire suit? Hey, CB, you did a great job getting us here and everything,  but I got this, all right?|I got a sword arm, so—
 Yeah, you said that.|Watch this.  Hey, guards! Come at me at the same time!
  What are you doing?!|Let's go, Princess! 
 But that wasn't the plan! No!|Ha-ha!
 Capture them!| Ahhhhhh—
 No, Finn, don't hurt them! They're entranced!| Oh, right.  Oh, no.
   Hyah! Um...  |There's CB!
 Whoo, get him, boys! We're taking these two away.|Don't worry, FP, your boy Finn won't fail you.
 |Trust me. It'll be fine.
 Never!|Yeah! It's because you secretly still have feelings for me.
 No!| Hmm.
 |Jeez. Did I just get shown up by Cinnamon Bun?
 What?|Why are you holding your bass up high like that?
 Mm-mm-mmm. (I don't know.) I get better finger action this way.|But you look like a nerd. Move it back down. It's better.
 Move the bass down.|A-move the bass a-down.
 And still looking good!|Do you remember anything from when you were the Ice King?
 Nothing specific—just dreamlike impressions.|Do you still have impressions from all the times we flipped your bricks?
 Well, yes, but only in increments. I've still got work to do. Finn and Jake, will you run my generator?|Yeah, man.
 Hmm...|Yeah, but...
 O-kay... Let's try something else.  These are cupcakes.|Cup-cups!
 Um...| Yes.
  Maybe we need something more hands-on. Hey, Finn, listen, that's it for class today.|Whoop!  Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop...
 I mean, you guys are cool and all, but I mostly came back here so I could stop thinking about y'all all the time. I'll be back when I'm tired of being free.  See you in a thousand years, I guess. Peace!|Wow. I really thought he was gonna stay.
 Me too. I even wrote a song about it.|
 Hey! Don't laugh.|Let me hear it!
 No! It's terrible.|Come on!
 No!|Come on! Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it...
 Boo! That was pre-written. It's so obvious! Take him out, Finn!|Off...
 Nope.|Off the dome, here we go. Uh! I'm-a start it now. I'm-a battle now. We gonna make a rhyme, so I can rap this time. I rap for millions...  sesquipedalians.
 Yeah, that was tight.|Whoo!  Huh? Rap Bear, what's wrong, man?
 How can I be Rap Bear if I'm not the best?|No way! You are the best! Going up against you was a dream come true. I look up to you, man. You're like... You're like my hero, Rap Bear.
 I thought Billy was your hero.|Yeah, but Billy's dead, so... Billy.
 Ha-ha! Check out these dummies.| Ha-ha! Yeah! You're awesome Billy! Ha-ha!
 You're gonna pay for this, Billy!|Sick.
 Finn! Finn! Finn.|Huh? Who dat?
 I'm Canyon, Billy's ex-girlfriend.|Say what?! That's so weird. I was just—  Party Pat was just like—
 What's going on here? Who's that?|This is Billy's ex-girlfriend.
 Oh, man, I'm sorry. Well, I hope you guys get back together. Whoo-oop! |Jake's still in denial about Billy.
 Billy and I broke up four years ago, but I held on to this. | Billy's loincloth!
  Oh, that's some smelly. |Thank you, Canyon. I guess I've been in denial, too. Have you been back to Billy's crack?
 No, I can't.|It's time to go see Billy's crack.
 Shouldn't Jake be here?|He needs more time. This would mess him up too much. 
 He needs more time. This would mess him up too much. | Fairies! Oh, they've infested the place! Okay, you guys, out! This is Billy's crack.
 We have dibs on the crack, so beat it!|I'll dib up your brains if you don't respect the mems of Billy.
 All right.|Laters.
 Laters.|Um, so, Canyon, why did you and Billy break up?
 Huh? Oh. Well, I loved Billy, and I believed in him, but then Billy stopped believing, and that jammed up our whole deal—being a top-tier, red-belt power couple. After a while, all he did was watch movies and play video games. Pretty lame, right? So I bailed.|Even heroes have slumps, bro.
 What the—? |What is it?
 It looks like Billy's bucket list.|Whoa, let me see!
 Whoa, let me see!|"Hmm. Looks like he got to most of these. He sure lived a full life. Okay, here's one. Wait. ""Tell Finn that thing."" What the butt is that?"
  I don't know.|Okay, that's gonna bother me forever. Well—well, here's one more. We should do it for Billy.
 Are you sure you're okay?|
 |Holy shram! Whoo!
 That was awesome, Finn. You know, you remind me of Billy when he was young.|Whoa. So... can I see you sometime?
 I have a feeling our paths will cross again. Take care, Finn.|" ""Take Canyon on one last ride.""  Whoops.  What? Another item? You sneaky Billy. ""Lie on my back in the ocean. Just float."" Cool.  Why the ocean, Billy?!"
"  ""Take Canyon on one last ride.""  Whoops.  What? Another item? You sneaky Billy. ""Lie on my back in the ocean. Just float."" Cool.  Why the ocean, Billy?!"|Okay, Finn, don't think about your fear. Just jump in there like it's no biggie. Do it for Billy. For Billy!
 Okay, Finn, don't think about your fear. Just jump in there like it's no biggie. Do it for Billy. For Billy!|I'm afraid. I'm afraid! Oh, dang, here he comes! Here comes the Fear Feaster!
 Huh? Uh, hey, man, don't do anything stupid. Hey! You're too chicken to face your fears with open eyes? This stank is cheating!|This stank is for Billy. 
 No! |Huh?  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
 Huh?  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!|For Billy!
 Wake up. Wake up!|
 |Huh? Whoa!
 What?! |Was that you or me? Huh? Hey. Hey! I—I'm doing it!  I'm not afraid of the ocean anymore! I'm doing it, Billy.
 You finished my list. Now I can rest like a great hero. Thank you, Finn.|You're welcome. Canyon helped, too.
 Tell Canyon I watch her sleep. Man, love is weird, Finn.|I know. Is that the thing you wanted to tell me?
 No. Goodbye.|Wait. Billy!
 What?|What's the thing you wanted to tell me?
 Oh, uh, you must go to the Citadel. That's where your father is.|Joshua's not alive. Me and Jake buried him behind the—
 Not Joshua! Your other dad. Dad the Human.|What?
 Laters.|Jake, where were you?
 Come on, man! I don't even take Lady up there.|Dude, I found out my human dad is still alive.
 Whoa, what?| He's at some place called the Citadel.
 Whoa.  Are you gonna go see him?|I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe there's a good reason why he didn't raise me. Like, he was probably captured by thieves and kept a slave for years.
 Yeah, or maybe he was ambushed in the wild and hid you so you wouldn't be captured, too.|Yeah, maybe it's better not to rock the boat.
 But... it might also be good to find out if you have any genetic risk factors or allergies or whatever. Plus, you get to see what you'll look as an old guy. Could be cool.|Heh. I guess it would be okay to meet him, just to know what I'll look like.
 Whoa! You guys do not wanna go there. Seriously.  Check this out.  The Citadel is a nasty-sized prison. Only the worst of the worst end up there. Real stink faces. These guys are the pits—the armpits.|Hey, my dad must be like the warden there.
 Check it out! I got gifts for you guys.|Ha, cool it's a penlight.  Jake, don't look directly me in the—Aaah!
 Oh! One last thing, dudes.  Whatever you do, don't wake him up.  Okay, you can go now.| Pew! Pew!
  Pew! Pew!|You ever wonder what happened to make a place all wrecked up like this?
  Hey! Get out here, old man!| Dude, shh. Don't wake him up.
  Hey, get out here, old man.|Pizow! 
 Pizow! |Old man.
  Uh oh!  Finn, a little help?|Bizzow
 Gizzow|Let's hoof it!
 Let's hoof it!|Jake, don't jostle the package.
 Jake, don't jostle the package.|Yahct!  All right! 
 Yahct!  All right! |There's too many of them!
  Dude's got serious night terrors. | What now, Prismo?
 Yeah,  I just wanted one last look at myself.|Wait, this old man is you?
 Killing a wish master is a cosmic crime. Once I'm dead, the guardian will show up and take you to The Citadel.|I don't think seeing my dad is worth sacrificing your life
 Prismo, don't worry! I'll put the old man to sleep and get you back!|Dude! That means The Lich jacked our entry into The Citadel.
 Hello!|Wait, wait, wait, wait!
 Wait, wait, wait, wait!|Look, Jake.  More guardians. The Citadel, I presume.
 Likely so.|Hey. Do you think maybe one of them could be my dad?
 Eh, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him.|Right, right. That makes sense.
 Right, right. That makes sense.|Hey! The Lich again! This must be where the prison cells be at. See? Good riddance, too. I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk-clapper. Some people just make the world a worse place to be in just by being around, Jake.  That's right. Bad apples. Lock 'em all up, I say. At the bottom of the ocean, where it's too dark to see.
 Look at that weird ol' kid over there. He looks just like you.  Man, look at his clo—|Daddyyy!  Aah!  All locked up in there. D-Do you think maybe he's a criminal too?
  Well, it had crossed my mind.| Jeez, man! Now I wish I hadn't said all that stuff before. Now my heart feels yellow and green.  Maybe we shouldn't even have come here—waah!?  Jake, what did you do?
 It wasn't me! It came from up there!| He's melting the crystal all up!  Breaking cats out left and right! Turning cats gray! Did he trick us again!? I think he did!
 Thanks, kid. Now, where'd you guys park your Star Skipper?  This place is coming down quick, and I mean quick, like zip zip. Like wow, like boom boom wow.|Oh. We... we don't have a Star Skipper.
 Son? Oh, hey, good for you, kid. In other news, I still gotta get out of here and the ground is melting. Huh?  It's all pooling in the center.|Hey, um... I... I wanted to ask you something. I... well...  Hey, wait up!   Dad, wait!  Dad, I need to ask you —- aah! 
  Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me, if both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry yours off too.|What? No.  Listen, you don't gotta worry about a thing, Jake ol' pal.  We just need to defeat those five space villains, hijack the shard they're hijacking and sail it home to safety.  Easy peasy.
 Yeah, Jake, smarten up. As soon as the last guardian dies, the fighting stops. See? He's bitin' the dust right now.|Aahh! Uh oh! 
 It's-- It's okay. It's okay.  You just gotta fetch me a gob of that guardian blood, son. It's got that good nooch that keeps us young in the crystal.|Nooch?
 Come on now, partner.  No dawdling, yer old man needs ya. |
 Hey, good job, son! Now, rub some of that sap on my leg there. Make sure to get it into the chicken wing hole.| Dad...
 Martin!|Okay, M-Martin. We need to talk.
 Yeah, okay, kid, but hurry it up. I'm trying to act cool here, but this thing really stings!| Why'd you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby!?
 Oh... I mean... Heh. You know me. I'm a funny guy!|
 Dude!!  S'mores important junk happening! Look!|It's time to peel bananas on this fool, as a family!  How about it, Martin?  Dad?
  I gotta run to the store!| Hrm.  Wha?
 I will command a great and terrible army; and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am beyond strength. I am the end.  And I have come for you, Finn. | What? You don't like this stuff, huh?  Whoa!  Right in the doorbell.  Dad.  Jake, finish off the Lich. I gotta go catch my dad.
 Finn, forget that loser!|Dad, wait!
 Hey, cool guys. Looking for a new boss?  Chew faster, that guy's really moving.| Dad! Stop!
  Finn! | Martin, I won't let you escape!
 It'll be okay, dude.| I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right?
 |Huh?  Oh, my garf! What are they?!
  It can't end like this.| James!
  James!|I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?
 |Wow. James sacrificed his life for you again, PB.
 Yeah, that's like the twenty-fifth time, right?|Yeah, obviously we'll have to re-clone him.
 James is too reckless. I can't reward this kind of foolish behavior forever. It's time James takes his eternal nap.|But it's James!
 I'm putting my foot down. There will be no more Jameses.|No...
  And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake?|Yeah, he ate that whole cupcake. What a guy...
 Yeah, he ate that whole cupcake. What a guy...| Is this... James heaven?
  Jameses!  Alright, who's in charge here?|James...
 Well... I was lonely! I knew Princess Bubs would make a new James if, you know, a James died a hero. So...|You faked your own death?
 Yeah! I just wanted a friend.  Someone who gets me!|James...
 Plus, each time I get kerplonked, I get another shiny medal, and why have two medals if you can have all the medals? Medals, medals, medals...|Dude, I've been to your funeral like twenty-five times.
  PB ain't gonna like this.|Hmm hmm!
 Nah, man. PB's no dummy. She'll find out. It's only a matter of time.|We like you James but, you're on your own. We're gonna sit this one out.
 We like you James but, you're on your own. We're gonna sit this one out.|This should be good.
  What a show!|Very enjoyable!
 Okay! Weeoo weeoo weeoo weeoo...  Ah! Can't fight! |Yoink!
 Hey!|Heeyah!Aww! Don't touch the monsters! They'll melt you! Oh my jerbs! Jake! Let's help these candy orphans!  Hey kids! 
 I hereby award thee...Jameses...These medals for bravery.|Dat's my boi, Jameses!
  MY ARM!!!|   Oh!  Parm, parm, parm.  Asiago's like parm.  Whoopsies.   Okay, now easy does it.
    Oh!  Parm, parm, parm.  Asiago's like parm.  Whoopsies.   Okay, now easy does it.|Ohh!
 Ohh!| Thanks a lot, Dad!
 Finn?  What's going on?  Is the spaghetti all—whoa!  Finn, what happened?|I... messed up the spaghetti,  and then I got mad, and PB's candy arm exploded.
  Man, I knew that arm was bogus.|Yeah, it wasn't the greatest. Sorry about the spaghetti, though.
 Man, don't worry about that.  You just went through some outrageous beeswax from losing your favorite arm and et cetera. You can't just expect to bounce right back to normal.|I can't?
 Nah, man. Listen.  All these princesses donating all these gross fake arms—they mean well,  but they're throwing you off your game! You got to go at your own pace. If you listen  deep in your melon heart...  that's where the real instructions are.| My melon wants to punch my dad in the face and steal his arm.
  Well, those things are bad,  so they can't be the real instructions, but you keep listening. Me—I'm going to go to the spaghetti store and buy a new mop head. I'll be back soon. Just remember—listen to your melon heart. | Melon heart... melon heart... man, I don't know. It'd be so easy if I could just go find him—my dad that is. That portal he went through after ripping off my favorite arm went right to outer space. And outer space is up there somewhere... I'm told. Maybe Banana Man could help me build a rocket or something...  or some stairs or... something, something, something... or, or, or.   Wow, it's like a—like a—like a magic Finn arm.  She's powerful. You must've exploded the candy arm before and made the rock pile just know. It's almost like I'm trying to tell myself something, like a message from my melon heart.
  That means lay off. Finn's feeling this one out solo style. Give the kid a chance.| Daddy's got an arm and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.  Baby's building a tower into space. Space is where he's gonna find his dad.  Daddy's got an arm and  baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.  Baby's building a tower into space. Space is where he's gonna find his dad. Daddy's got an arm, and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.
  Ahh!| Oh, hi.
   Get out of my house or I'm going to face blaaaast you.| Hi.
  Hi.| Waah.
   Yep, yeah. I know you. You're one of those swimmers right? A reeeal swim nut.| What? No, I'm Finn. 
  Well you can't swim in me. Not anymore, I'm not water. You can't get me up your nooooose. |  Okay, I'm going to keep going.
  I'm going to keep going, into here. |  Oh, baby's a tower into space. Space where he's gonna find his dad.
   Goodnight buddy, I'm proud of you.|  Baby's building a tower into space, to tear off his dad's arm.  From like where that round of the arm bone meets that weird flat bone on the top of the back. Gonna pull that until it comes off. Baby's building a tower of revenge...
  Hey kid.  It's me again. Carroll, my name's Carroll.| Finn.
  Finn, look I'm sorry about blasting you yesterday. Hey man, are you really gonna do those things?|  Uh, yeah, for revenge. I think it'll feel good.
  I get it, I get it. But let me tell you something. I used to be water. Like a pond or something real wet. I used to hate people swimming in me,  kicking and stuff. So what did I do? I evaporated, I got myself out of there.| You should have pulled off their legs.
  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, you have to stop obsessing about revenge.  Umph.  Be like me and run away, you have to run away and never stop hating your old life.  You gotta really dwell on it. Ah!| What was that?
  I just thought about my anxieties and it's like my mind hand touched a hot memory stove.| Hmm.
  Ah!| Interesting. Oh hey, what are your thoughts on melon hearts?
   Finn! Hey what's it like up there?  I figured I could turn into spaces, or something.|  Daaaad!?  Ah. Oh man. My nog master.  Hello?  Hell-oh!  Hey, hey dad?
  Huh? Oh good, you're awake.|  Gotcha! Ha, ha, hee, hee, hee, hee.  Give, give it. Give me the... give me give it. Give me the...
  Oh, my favorite arm.|  Butts. Butts.
  Didn't help much did it.| No. Wait, what?
  Bong Bong.  Sorry buddy.| PB? Wait, where am I?
  We're in the Candy Kingdom fallout shelter.  I brought you here after you passed out on the tower. You were hallucinating like crazy so it was really easy to trick you. I figured you'd thank me later after learning your lesson.| Right, right.
  And look, the arm is gone too. See?  So what do you think?| Hmm.  Yeah, okay. Thanks Princess.
  Oh, hey buddy you're back. How are you feeling?| Um, neutral I guess. I don't want to punch my dad anymore.
  Ha, Ha! That's great!  You can always trust the old melon heart to get you through.  So I guess we won't be needing this thing anymore. You wanna do the honors?|  Yes I do.
  Hmm....|What is it?
 It's looking droopier.|But I've been pounding pickle juice like I was preggos. For the electrolytes.
 Well, switch back to water. But what I really want to know, is how are you feeling Finn?|What? Oh, I don't know. , I guess I don't feel anything. Bleh. 
 Okay, that's what I thought. You gotta bounce back, man. You got burned by your bad dad, you lost your arm, and all the ladies say you don't talk to Flame Princess no more.|Who's sayin' that?
 Finn, flowers thrive on good vibes. As your doctor, I'm ordering you to go out and have fun, okay?|You want to go with me to Crab Princess' party tonight?
 Uh, what? Like... as a date?|Sure. That would be fun, right?
 Finn, I don't date my patients.|It's cool. Guess I'll go make out with Crab Princess.
" Okay. Tell her I said ""hi."""|♪I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring? Autumn descends on me,Autumn♪
 ♪What do I see? Oh, so beautiful. My heart it beats. Oh, so magical.♪|♪I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring?♪
 ♪I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring?♪|
  Hey, Finn, could you pour this juice into my mouth?|What? Pfft!  Aah!
 I can't reach my juice.| Yo, come on bee! Geez!
 Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize—|Didn't realize what? That there's a person attached to this flower?
 Uh, yes. I'm sorry. But it's only because your flower's the greatest miracle of all time. It's just doing something to me, I—|Oh, that's cool. Thanks, beezy.
 So uh, what are you doing here? Heh.|Ah, well, I came here to make out with Crab Princess, but I sort of lost steam on the walk over.  I don't know what crabs are into. I'm just gonna stop trying and let my flower wilt away. Who cares?
 I'll try for you, man.|Whoa! Really?
 Thanks for walking me home, Finn. I'd invite you over, but you can't breathe underwater, right?|Not usually, but can I have a kiss, please?
 Uh, okay...|Okay. Good night, Crab Princess.
 Hey, you did it!|Oh, you're still here.
 Yeah,  just checking in... on my buddy. So, how you feelin', buddy?|"Pretty grease. I made out with Crab Princess, so that's grease. But really I don't feel nothing. Maybe if I made out, I will feel something? Maybe I'll reach a ""good vibe"" saturation point. And then my flower will feel good, too..."
 Your flower feels good, yes.| Hey, cut it out, Breezy.
 Ha ha! I'm just messin' around. We're buddies, right?|Yeah, Breezy, I like you. You're a good wingman.
 |
 |What's up with your head?
 Whoa. You're a dead ringer for Flame Princess, with a smidge of Princess Bubblegum mixed in.  Guess you're still hung up on both of 'em, bro.| I ain't hung up on nobody! Nobody. Breezy, let's get out of here.
 Okay.|She doesn't look anything like Flame Princess, does she?
 I don't know who that is.|Exactly.  I'm just trying to have fun. You know, doctor's orders. But I still ain't feelin' nothing.  maybe I should just let this poor flower die.
 Noooo... Listen, buddy, being a free spirit is fun and all, but you got a responsibility to that flower, just like I got a responsibility. Get this—I'm actually a virgin queen bee. I was born to lead a hive, destined for a life of obligation and ritual.|Whoa. Bummer.
 Yes. Once I drink of the royal jelly, my carefree days are done.|Dang. That sounds like raw deez. Breezy, you got to stay free... Free to make out with whatevs. 
 Yeah, maybe you're right. You know, it's too bad we're such great buddies or we could make out with each other. |What?
 That's right. Everybody's havin' fun...|Whoops!
 Girl, get back to your hive! Quit hanging out with that bologna tube! It's disgusting!|Mnh-mnh.  Yo! Shut it! She's an independent lady!
 Gonna teach you to mind your b's and q's, chump!  Buzzzzz!|Uh! Run, Breezy!
 Uh! Run, Breezy!|Aah!
 You're about to get waggle-danced, you chicken!  Unh!|Ow! Ooh! 
  aha!  Don't worry, Finn!  I jacked some royal jelly from their hive! | Breezy... No!
 Hey, honeybuns!|
 Whoa! Oh, No! She got into our secret sauce, bro! It's all over!  Long live the queen!| Breezy?
 Yes, Finn. Can't you see? I've become a queen to save you because... I love your flower and—and I think... I love you!  Now you can partake of my pollen crumbles and become my drone.|Um... You know, I'm—I'm trying to keep it casual, B. I just don't feel the same way. I don't feel anything.
  But I royal jellied for you. |I'm lost in the darkness, Breezy.
 Wha? Where you going?|That's it. We made out.
 Wha—What?! I didn't wait infinity for a dip in the kiddie pool! We're taking this to the deep end!|But I'm not a good swimmer.
 Don't be scared, Finn. Lumpy's on lifeguard duty.| How's it going, guy? Is any of this helping?
  How's it going, guy? Is any of this helping?|I'm gonna forget you did that. Right in the vault.
 I'm gonna forget you did that. Right in the vault.|Whoa, whoa, whoooooa!
 Whoa, whoa, whoooooa!| Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
  What the lump? Oh, hey! Finn, you got your arm back!| Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Breezy...
 Whoa-a-a!|Hmm. Why would I need to learn about caterpillar families? I don't get it.
 Well, they look like they're having fun.| Real leaves aren't made out of candy. They always have a gross, bitter taste.
 Mmm! Ah, it's so good!|Ugh. That's gross, too. There's no way real caterpillars are delicious.
 You guys, this is lame.|No way I'm eating a bug's butt. Those kids are right. Whats the big deez about the food chain, anyway? Lets hit the snack bar and eat something yummy.
 No way I'm eating a bug's butt. Those kids are right. Whats the big deez about the food chain, anyway? Lets hit the snack bar and eat something yummy.|Hey, this is pretty fun!
 Hey, have you noticed we are birds now?|I'm hungies.
 |Oh, dude, you ate those?!
 Come on, man. We're sweet, sweet birds, and we get to eat worms. This is a unique experience.|
 |
 | Uh, how did I get so mad chubs? I only ate one grub.
 Dude, you've been eating grubs for hours.|What?!
 Yeah, you're a beast.|Help me, Jake! My body's too bloated to fly!
 Hide!|
 | There goes my din-din. Why am I hungry again?
  There goes my din-din. Why am I hungry again?|Jake!
 Who are you?|It's me, Finn.
 Dang, when did you get so big?... And old?|
 You feeling okay, bro?|Jake, we are good friends. So let me just say you look awesome right now.
 Ha, really?|Yeah.
 Yeah.|You're looking tasty.  Hey, why don't you take a seat in my mouth?
 Why? That's... weird.|It's okay. It's okay. Just give it a try. It's a new experience, right?
 Wow, you have a lot of saliva.  You must have a broken pipe, old timer. It's comfy, though.|
 Whoa! Did you just try to eat me?!|No...? But if I did that'd be okay, right?
 You are trying to eat me.|I'm just following the Law of Nature.
 What're you talking about?|I don't know. I just feel that way. 
 |Aw, Jake, you're missing out... by not getting eaten... by me.
 Sorry, man. I'm not into it.|So alone. So hungry.  The Law of Nature... has claimed this... bod... 
 So alone. So hungry.  The Law of Nature... has claimed this... bod... |Yay! What a big turnout. Top notch! To decompose stuff! Yeah-h-h! We are so pumped! Yeah!  What's that smell?
 Yay! What a big turnout. Top notch! To decompose stuff! Yeah-h-h! We are so pumped! Yeah!  What's that smell?|Wow. It looks amazing! Yay! Yay!
 Wow. It looks amazing! Yay! Yay!|Party time!
 Party time!|So good! Awesome. This bird went bad so well!
 You took it too far, man. I'm a dog, and I eat all kinds of horrible things. This is disgusting.|"Come on, think of it as a conversation starter—like, ""The other night, I ate the grossest thing I've ever tasted."" You know, it's interesting. "
" Come on, think of it as a conversation starter—like, ""The other night, I ate the grossest thing I've ever tasted."" You know, it's interesting. "|Whew! I'm full.
 Whew! I'm full.|Whoa! Aah!
 Whoa! Aah!|Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Aah! What's going on?! Whoa!
 Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Aah! What's going on?! Whoa!|
 |
 |I think we're safe now... and also caterpillars.
 We're still in a bind, man. No food, no water.|I'm hungry.
 Huh? You okay? |She's beautiful.
 Yes, I have to hurry and find food. Otherwise, my family won't survive.  But I don't know if I can go on... |Hold on, Erin. Food! Water! Shade! Where are you?!
 Over there—the oasis!| Yummy!
 Really? You like leaves now?|So good, dude.
 So good, dude.| Your eyes.
 So, how many kids you want to have?|Uh,  d-d-do you want to get married?
 And will you, Finn, take this caterpillar to be your wife, even if she becomes a flower or a bird or a bacteria, to love and to cherish till death do you part?|Y-y-y-yes.
 You may now kiss the bride.|This way, Erin!
 Finn!|When we're reborn as caterpillars, I'll marry you all over again!
 Hey, why are you eating caterpillars?|My eyes are open.
 Princess, he did it! Root Beer Guy set up the force field!|But he sacrificed himself to do it.
 Yes, it's been a difficult adjustment.|Blaze his face, Eli!
 Finn, his weakness is his brain seed.|Okay!
 Okay!|Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
 Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!|Oh, uh!  Aah! 
 Hey, where's Finn?|Hi.
 Okay. Y'all bring food and bevs. Finn, you make the guac, all right?|I'll make the guaaaaaaaaaaac.
 Finn! Finn!|Yo! What's up, APTWE?
 What do I do now?|Dude, I don't know. Probably not go back in the basement. You're so big'uns. You should be free, boy.
 Free to do what? I need psychic commands.|Can you help me dice tomatoes for this guac?
 No.|You see, man, I feel weird giving you orders. You should just do your own thing. Realize your potential.
 But this is what I am—a war machine who serves its master.|No, man. You're more than that.  Whoops. I see into your brain, remember? You'll do great. Just go for it. I believe in you, man.
 No, man. You're more than that.  Whoops. I see into your brain, remember? You'll do great. Just go for it. I believe in you, man.|Oh, word. Thanks.
 Maybe Darren was right. There's no place for my ancient ways. |Don't think like that, dude! Come back and see us whenevs!
  Whoo!|Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
  Yeah? Yeah. Send them on over.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, as you can see, this beauty offers direct first and second floor access. Superb craftsmanship and etcetera. I suppose you're familiar.  Yes, Finn?|Yeah, uh, when are we going to get our house back?
  Good afternoon! Yes, right this way.  I've got 37 available units to show in this building so we're going to want to get right to it. Please step inside.  There you go. Is that everyone? Good, good. Please make your way upstairs and we'll begin the tour.  And you two make yourselves at home. Rent's due on the first, no overnight guests. Oh, and flush once after you boom-boom but before you start using the TP, and then once more in the middle of using the TP if you're going to use a lot. It's easier on the pipes. Okay. Call me if you need me. |
 Hey Finn. I'm real sorry about this. Somehow I feel like it's kinda my fault.|Nah man. It's really not so bad. Let's just sleep on it tonight. 
 You're gonna sleep... like that?|Yeah, man. It's tough. I'm a tough kid.
 Haha, yeah. I can't wait to wash my gross, fat butt. |
  I just feel if we're patient this whole thing will work itself out before you know it.  Haha! See, man? Help is on the way!| Man, can I tell you something? I don't even know what's going on here. I mean like, what the heck is a deed? How come he can buy our house when it's OUR house and Marceline gave it to us and we live there?! A-and now we're arrested?! This is crazy! It's crazy!! 
 Man, don't you know? The laws ain't made to help earthy cats like us.|They're not?!
" Nah, man. Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old days, back in the REAL old days, it was just every man for hisself. Scrooblin' and scrat-scroblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scroblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, ""The rest of you, y'all scrats get sand!"" And THAT'S when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they liked it, they said, ""This is fair now, this is the law."" Once they were winning, they changed the rules up."|Woah, just like Kim Kil Whan!
 Haha, that's awesome!|Yeah, awesome!
  Man, where did I go wrong?|I don't know. But I'm not tryin' to be sleepin' on a ladder anymore, so let's just get a bunch of scroot together and buy our house back. Then you two can hash it out later.
  Yeah, you're right. So, wanna rob a bank or somethin'?|Well, actually...I was thinking maybe Kim Kil Whan was right.  Maybe we should get jobs or somethin'.
 Oh yeah.... Yeah. Oh no, wait! I just remembered I buried a ton of gold in the front yard!|Yuss!!
  Oh yes, yes, absolutely. Small pets are allowed with an additional deposit.  Excellent.| Watch it!
 Other| Hey, Abracadaniel's here, with a bus full of lame wizards.
  Okay, you guys. Keep up the good work. | What was your count?
 Uh, 3 minutes. What about you?|Uh, 3 minutes, 30 seconds.
 What's that? Your invisible watch?|No, I was just pointing at my wrist.
 Oh, dang, we were both counting fast.|Hey, Rattleballs, are you sure you're waterproof?
 Birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday , birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday,  birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday! Yeah! Yay!|Nice job, Mr. Birthday Boy.
  Thanks.|Man, you are like another year older, but you look good. Like, super good.
 Yup. Mom and dad passed down some pretty good genes.|Oh yeah, mom and dad. Hey, did mom and dad tell you any stories about when you were born?
 And so they never told me.|Never told you what?
 I don't know. I think I got restless leg syndrome.|Is that from getting chubby?
 What? No, man, it's just restless leg.|Oop! My bad.
 What are you reading?|This old copy of Adventure Boy magazine—the only magazine for boy adventurers. This kid Rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters. This magazine rules! But I'm saving the end for tomorrow. 
 Cool.|Well, I hope your leg feels better. I'm turning in. I'll see you up there.
  Finn, was that you?|
 Aah!  Aah! Ghost fly touching me!  Finn! Finn!| Aah!
 Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah!|Okay.
 Come on, man. Let's get out of the house. It's a ghost fly!|So what?
 Run! Just run!|Ay-ay-ay-ay!
 We should ask what its unfinished business is. Ghosts always have unfinished business.|Ghost fly, what's your problem?!
 Ghost fly, what's your problem?!|Come on, dude. Tell us your unfinished business!
 Come on, dude. Tell us your unfinished business!|Aah! It's no good. He's a tortured little spirit. We need help to communicate with this ghost fly.
 I think so. His ways are kind of mysterious.|That's cool.
 Woo! |Hmm?
 Hmm?| The end of my story. And it's so close.
 Don't do it, bro. It's a trap.|I know. It's an obvi trap. But wait. What if... watch this. Ha!  Mm?
 Dude, what are you—?|If I extend the circle...  farther... I can get closer to the magazine.
" Yeah, but I'm still getting a ""woo-jah"" feeling. This seems like a bad idea."|Just have to stay inside this circle.
 Just have to stay inside this circle.|Ha ha! How'd you do it, Rusty? How'd you shake them otters?   Man, what a great ending! 
 Finn? What's wrong, buddy?| 
 Mm. BMO?|Jake, I missed you, bro!
 Jake!|Don't ever leave me again!
 Alright, lad, show me the way! |Jake! Hey, I got a for-real important question
  I thought you'd be beautiful. But you're not!  You're hideous! Hideous! | BMO, resume.
 Go eat, Jake!|Uh, Jake? What's going on, man? Feeling okay?
 Awesome. See you soon.  Yus!|Hey, man.
 Oh, hey, Finn!  So you got my map? | Yeah.
 |So... how's your experiment going?
 Ah, it's goin' great. I really feel like I fit in,  so to speak. |So... are you ready to come home?
 Nah, I think I was just gonna keep being a brick for a while.|Umm... what are you doing again?
 Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it. Like sandcastles in the sun, baby.  You're too young; you wouldn't understand.| You're right. I don't understand. But I'm cool with your mystical journey or whatever. I'm gonna leave this walkie-talkie so we can stay in touch. Just in case.
 What? No, man, bricks don't stay in touch!|Dude, BMO is, like, really worried about you.
 Aww. You tell that little goofball I said hi.|I will.  Well, I guess I should head back.
 Oh. Really? So soon?|Yeah, well, it took me, like, half a day to get here. Besides, you're just a brick, right?
  Yeah.| Alright, see ya, Jake!
 Wow, deers are jerks.|Hey, man. You know I can hear everything you say, right?
 What?! Arrrrrgh! No! I had no idea.|Yeah, but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie, and I left it on. You know that, right?
 Hi, BMO.|Need anything? A soda?
 No.|So what's Mr. Bunny doing now?
 It's not about the bunny! The bunny is incidental to the brick experiment.|Oh. Sorry, man.
 Forget about the bunny.|Sorry, man.
 Sorry, Jake.|Look, we'll, uh, we'll leave you alone. 
 Aw.|Jake? Jake? You there, buddy? Over.
 Hey, Finn.|Hey, man. You ready to come home?
 That sounds good.|Awesome. See you soon.  Yus!
  Blech. Your tooth looks bad, dude. It smells like a garden shed in here.|
 Finn, I think you have to go dentist.|I can't go dentist, Jake! You gotta take care of it.
  Just go dentist, dude.  Okay. Easy does it... |
 |
  This is so bad. What did Princess Bubblegum say when you showed her?|Aaaaaaaaaah.
 Hmm. Finn, this is literally serious. You have to go dentist.|NOOOOOOO!
 Dude. You. Got. To. Go. Dentist.|Blech.  NOOOOO! I'm too strong for the world!  I don't want to go dentist, Jake. They put you in a hole filled with snakes and rotten butter and they leave you there.
 Come on, man. It's not that bad.| Okay.
  Okay.|
 Whup!| This isn't so bad...  My sword! Wonder wh— 
  This isn't so bad...  My sword! Wonder wh— |Soft sand.  Ant.
 Welcome to dentist, cadet.  I'm Leftenant Gamergate.  Snakes and rotten butter. A common mistake—you were expected to arrive with snacks and a flashlight. Either way, you're here.|So... dentist is ants?
 Dentist is dentist, cadet! Drop and give me twenty!|I don't have any money.
 Funny man goes dentist, huh? The queen's office is in the royal hill.|Holes.  Hmm.
 As a first-time recruit, I'm confident that you have no idea what you're doing here.|My tooth hurts.
 Let's take a look at your file.  Ah, you're a fighter!  We could use a fighter.|My tooth hurts.
 What? Of course it does. Let me explain. You have gone dentist. That means that you will serve a brief tour of duty, and in exchange we will provide full dental rehabilitation. You will be on the front, fighting monsters... monstrous monster wooorms!|Worms.
 The worms are employed by the flies.|Worms.
 Work for the flies. You fight them; we'll fix your teeth.|Me.
 Yes, you!  Your mission is to secure this junction at all costs. Upon completion of service, you will be sworn to absolute secrecy. The flies have spies everywhere. Fly spies!|Heh heh. 
 These worms are no joke, so you'll be assigned a partner. Ah, let's see... Cadet... Tiffany Oiler.|Tiffany?!
  Tiffany! Finn, I'm gonna kill you!|That guy wants to kill me!
 Cadets, dinner is being served in the mess hall, central hill, sub-tunnel eight.|Hm. Do you have anything less sugary?
 Yo, Finn! I'm gonna kill you!|  Doin' it for my tooth. 
  Ruff! Thought so. | Hey, uh, partner. Um. So how are you doing, Tiffany?
 Yeah, I lost my teeth eating the Baker's Shard. It's a lot of sugar, right?|Oh. Did you already know what dentist is?
 See, this is a good example of why I want to kill you. You're ignorant.  Heed my words, Finn. As the miller's wheel forever outrages the seed, so the good apple boringly receives his neighbor's worm.| The hey?
 You're getting greased!|Tiffany, look. We gotta work together, right? Why don't we let bygones be bygones?
 Bygones? Ha!  That's you. Bye!  Gone!| Do you want my peach?
 Tonight, light's out. Tomorrow, your eyes out!|What the stork, man? This is my special sword. Why didn't you take one of those ant swords they offered you back there?
 I don't need some fancy thinger to kick butt when I've got these!  You know about these?|No.
 You will. Anyway, I just kinda wanted your sword 'cause it's pretty cool, I guess. Whatever. I'll get it soon enough... from off your dead corpse, you chump! |
 |Hey, Tiffany... you know, we're really not so different, you and I.
 Bullstuff.|Well, we're both friends with Jake, and that's something, right?
 I was friends with Jake. Then some baritone herb stole him away from me.|I didn't steal him. We're broth—
 You get it? We're gonna steal actual whole buildings.|Yeah, I get it.
 So don't tell me we're not so different, okay?! We're opposites, you and me. Oil and goody-goody snow-white baby-vanilla bean mitten water! Go, Tiffany! | Man, that nut's gonna try and stick me while I'm not even looking.  Don't even stress it, Finn. You're Finn Mertens, man. You got this.  Man, I hope so.
 Finn! Get in here, quick!|The junction.
 There's something moving in the walls. It was like .|Wall worms! Holy cow!
 Wall worms! Holy cow!|Dang it, Tiffany, not yet! We got to work together to beat the worms! Here they come!
 Dang it, Tiffany, not yet! We got to work together to beat the worms! Here they come!|Tiffany!
 You good?|My tooth hurts.
 My tooth hurts.|Dang! It's the head worm, and she's livid! I say we get the heck out of heeeeere—!
 Finn!| Tiffany, quick! Pull me up! Quick, Tiffany! I'm slipping!
  Tiffany, quick! Pull me up! Quick, Tiffany! I'm slipping!|Dang it, Tiffany! Weren't you paying attention? We're two peas in a pod! We're not oil and water. We're oil and vinegar! It's good, man. It's yummy!
 Mm...|It's good for you!
 Why are you still smiling?|Sorry. I didn't hear what you said. I was just gonna let it slide.
 Catch you on the flip, I guess.|Tiffany?  Tiffa—  nooooooooo!
 Whoa! Easy, son. Don't try to speak. Your mouth is full of ants.|Huh?
 It's okay. We just finished up.|Ah.  What happened down there? Where's Tiffany?
 Well, the good news is the worm queen was defeated, choked to death on some foreign object, presumably Cadet Tiffany, who is missing in action, which is the bad news.|Tiffany...
 But we didn't have to fix his teeth, which is nice news. But we did have to fix your teeth, which is okay news.| Huh huh. Ayyyy!
 So, on behalf of the ant nation, I'd like to thank you for your service, which is now concluded. As soon as you're ready, we'll get you stuffed back up that well with all the snakes and butter.|Holy cow.
 Yeah. Welcome home, buddy.|Thanks, you guys! Man, you'll never believe it. Dentist is actually—
 Eh-eh-eh! |It was crazy! Tiffany was there—
 Whoa! Hey! Deh-deh-deh! |Wait. You all knew? What the heck? Why didn't you tell—
 Tree Trunks! The slumber party is about to start. Get those hot buns in here, girl!|"Did you hear me? I said, ""Get those hot—""!"
" Did you hear me? I said, ""Get those hot—""!"|Hi, Mr. Pig.
 Hi, Mr. Pig.|Why are you hitting me?
 Why are you hitting me?|I was just talking about Tree Trunks's hot—.
 Uh, uh...|Uh-oh, uh-oh!
 Oh! Heh.|You take it, Princess. This is your party.
 Heavenly thoughts. |Hey, PB.
 Hey, Finn.| Mm?
 Bup, bup, bup. Hey, you wanna ditch the party and go for a walk?|Wha—? Really?
 It's been a while since we just hung out, you know?|What about the Candy People?
 Ah, they should be fine, right? For once? Maybe they'll surprise me by being fine. Come on. |Whoa!
 Secret passage.|Noice.
" Yo, guys! You gotta do something! That's my best friend in there!  ""You okay in there?"""| Yeah, we went out the secret coat passage.
 It's so nice to get away sometimes.|Hmm. Candy peeps can be a handful, huh? 
  Timmy!|Aw! So squish!
 Hop on!|Okay. 
 So got any other weekend plans?|Mmm... probably gonna hit up the arts and crafts kingdom with BMO. You?
 Oh, I'm gonna garden some, plan next week's pizza lunch, answer 800 e-mails, and... you know, whatever.|Wows. Do you ever get tired from doing princess work all the time?
 Sure. I mean, it's a lot of responsibility  looking after so many people, though lately I have been trying to be more chill about it. |Cool, like taking ice cream breaks?
" Yeah, and, like, being more... sorta okay with everyone making mistakes around me. Like ""mind my own stuff"" more. You know what I mean?"|Yeah. Kind of like how I've been thinking about my dad and how I want him to act more like daddy. But, but maybe acting like daddy just isn't what he does. Maybe my dad's not a dad but a kid stuck in a dad's body.
 | Timmy knows what's up!
 Here, try this one.| Mmm... fire.
  You got a little edible fire mustache there.|What?  Gonna send this to Jake. 
 Hey, what's that?|Uh, it's—
 Let me see.|Mm. You won't like it, but okay. 
 I'll worry about it later.|Oh.
 You wanna see the burrito room?|Yuss!
 Man, this is intense. I better do something! |Thanks for showing me around, PB. I've enjoyed just, just hanging out.
 Me, too!| Jake just sent me a funny picture of himself. 
 Whoa. It looks like the Candy People's makeshift government has been taken over by a ruthless despot.|What? Why aren't you freaking out?
 Well, that's normal; people always have weird thoughts around campfires.|Well, I don't know. Isn't is sort of strange that we keep pets? We kind of make them worship us.
 What?! Nah. |No, seriously, think about it. We're their only source of food and water and, like, tummy rubs. They basically have to love us.
  What's wrong with tummy rubs?|Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great.  That one star is so crazy, looks like it's vibrating.  It's so cool. Wonder what it is, a planet? Do people live there? Are they friendly? Do they keep pets?
 Alright buddy,  that's a little too much campfire. Time for bed. |Whoa... holy.  Oh, dang.   Uh, okay.  Man, this is screwy. Maybe it's the can of beans we had for dinner.  Looks- uh- homey. Wuh-oh! Whoa-Aah!  Oh- right.
  Mmm, Boobafina, just pay me back when you can.|Aww.
 Hello? |Oh! Hey, you can see me?!
 See you...? But if I didn't see you... Wait, what did you originally ask me?|Oh, forget it, it's cool.
 Do you, want a drink or something? I think I only have water anyway. .|Whoop, here I go! Bye!
 Oh, that was sort of rude. I hope he comes back. | That guy seemed lonely, not a lot of foxes up at this hour.  Guess you get a lot of work done though.
 Quittin' time!  You don't have to go home but ya', oh, you know how it goes! |Bounce House Princess. . I didn't know B.H.P lived in a cave.  Hey, this place is pretty nice.
 | Whoa!
  Oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob!   six four three two one! .| Dude, what's your deal? 
  Everything's okay now.|Aww, geez, poor Bounce House Princess.
 | Wha?
  Bounce House Princess, you listen to me! Are you gonna' shut yourself off from other people forever?! I mean he or she could be really nice and- okay, mm, maybe if I just say very still, it'll just- it will just go away. | Gosh, I hope BHP's okay, I feel bad for just splittin' like that. Maybe they sorted it out, they could have stuff in common. You never know until you speak to the person.  Oh, hey, Cloud Kingdom.
  Gosh, I hope BHP's okay, I feel bad for just splittin' like that. Maybe they sorted it out, they could have stuff in common. You never know until you speak to the person.  Oh, hey, Cloud Kingdom.| What the? Ice King?

What the heck is going on though?  Everybody's leaving!
 What do you think, Finn the Human?|Wha? Who, me? You can see me too?
 Yes, I am Glob.|"Oh yeah. Hey, do you ever say ""Oh my Glob?"""
 No, but sometimes Gob does.  You're dreaming so far from home, it must be comet related.|Yeah, but, I gotta question.
 What's that?|Well, if just being born is the greatest act of creation.  Then what are you suppose to do after that?  Isn't everything that comes next just sort of a disappointment?  Slowly entropy-ing until we deflate into a pile of mush? 
 Well, it’s not enough to have created something amazing, right? What if I just let my Martian supersociety go to butt?|But what's it worth if we're all gonna get blowed up right now? 
 Whoa! What are you doing?!  |Ahhh!  Oh my bod!
  What is it, boyi?!|...Glob is dead.
 Ahh! Computer! What did we hit?!  Oh, blobs...  oh, for real blobs... | Hey, I think Bounce House Princess needs our help.
  Golly, it's awful nice of y'all to take Sweet P to school on his first day.|  Our pleas', T.T.!
"   You think he's still secretly evil, that he's still all ""Lich-y"" in there?"| Mm, not sure.
  I don't know, Finn, he just seems so... sweet! |  Mm.
   So far so good. | Fat squirrel in trub! Gah!  Oh, no! 
  Daww!| Hmm...
  Hmm...| Alright, welp, see you later, Sweet P! 
 Man, you know what's weird? That wasn't even a comet that crashed back there.  So, then, what was that dream about? I don't get my brain. Okay, when we get back to the tree house, let me do the talking.| 
 That's the comet you're supposed to follow.|Right. Right. I knew that. 
 Hey, be careful, okay? Hold on tight.|It's okay. I won't ever let you go.  That's... true.
 It's okay. I won't ever let you go.  That's... true.|Wow. Already? That was fast.
 Yep. We're here. It's time to wake up now.|What? Now?
 Yep.|Like, right now?
 Ye—| Ah. Where am I?  What the heck? Is that the comet?  And a little farming village? How long have I been walking?
 Man, two whole days—at least!|Wow. I need some water. 
 No, wait—ah... jeez.| Hmm... Fields are lookin' a little sparse.  Kinda runty... I wonder if this village even has any wat—oh, snap! I see some!
  Hmm... Fields are lookin' a little sparse.  Kinda runty... I wonder if this village even has any wat—oh, snap! I see some!|Excuse me, sir. Can I have some water? I've been sleepwalking for days.
 Excuse me, sir. Can I have some water? I've been sleepwalking for days.|Haha, awesome.  Haha! Heck yeah! Thanks, little friend! You just totally saved my life. No pun intended. What's the matter? Can't talk? Oh, or are you guys comet boys? From up in there? Listen, I'm no expert, but I think y'all are gonna need a lot more corn.  And it's suppose to stand straight up-like. Or maybe comet boys only need just, like, a little bit of limp corn?
  HUMAN BOY!|What the?
 THE TREE SPIRIT DOES NOT PERMIT FREELOADERS! EITHER HELP FETCH THE ESCAPE POD ENGINE OR KINDLY MOVE ALONG!|Dad?
 Wait, wait! What are you doing? DON'T COME OVER HERE.|Dad?
  Finn! What the heck are you doing here?| Dad! What the heck are you doing here?
  Dad! What the heck are you doing here?|What? You were just yelling at me.
 No, no, no, that was the tree spirit—commander of all trees, bringer of hard times.|Dad.
 You know those little guys down there, they'll do anything for the tree spirit. I've got them fetching parts to fix my escape pod, instead of planting their fields. Isn't that sweet?|Dad, your arm.
 Oh, this? Haha, yeah. When my ship crashed I got shot out of the window. I knocked a kite of the air, then caught my arm in a woodpecker hole.|Whoa.
 But, it's cool, you know. Arms come and go. It's family that's important.  Speaking of arms, though, I see you got yourself a brand spanking new one. How about that!|Oh. Yeah. I got it from my PB dream sword.
 Uh-huh. Neat.|Actually, for a while there, I thought if I ever saw you again, I was gonna tear your arm off.
 Well, shoot, who could blame you? Yeah. But you definitely don't feel that way anymore, right?|No, no, it's okay now.
  Haha! Great! How about a hug?|What the heck, Dad! Is everything you say a lie?
 No, no, of course not!|Well, is there any way I can tell the difference?
 Almost there. Little further. Aha, little further. Keep it coming. There you go. A li-i-ittle further. A-a-and stop.  Fantastic work, boys, absolutely fantastic.|Holy stonk, Dad! You're messing 'em all up.  This is why you are lying to them? So they'll mess themselves up for you?
 What! No, no, no, look! They love it, see?  Goochy goochy goo. Goochy goochy!  They're helping a poor old stranded man in need. You like to help people, don't ya? I'd do it myself if I could, but I'm too strong to fit through the service hatches. Come on, give me a chance.  They're gonna fetch me one last piece, and you and I can watch 'em do it. Then I'll be outta your hair by tomorrow morning.|Oh. Right.
 Yeah, don't worry. I know I'm cramping your style down here. Am I right? Huh?|Uh... yeah. Yeah, I-I guess...
 Sure I am! Now let's go fetch that piece.|It's really warm down here.
 Well, yeah, son. That's just the ship cooking. One thing about this ship, it cooks!|Should it be cooking?
 Nah, but that's just real life.  Okay, babies! I need this piece.  It's a steering wheel. It's in the steering room.  Last one in breaks tree spirit's heart!|Wait, wait, wai-wai-wait! You don't have to go in there if you don't want to!
 Finn?|Oh, sorry. So you guys wanna learn another one?  Ok, watch this. Heh, cute. Uh, hey!  So, you guys really believe in the tree spirit?
 Eh, not really, I guess. We're kind of just looking to help out.|Hmm.
 Hey! It's Finn with the grin! Mind if I sit down?  Haha! Look at this! You ever see someone sit like this?|I guess not. Hey, Martin?
 Yeah.|Uh, I think I really need some answers to stuff—like where did I come from or who's my mom?
 Everything is ruined. Everyone is fat.|Aah!   Martin! 
  Again?  Oh, good morning, sweetie!|Martin, are you leaving?!
 I absolutely gotta, kid. I got pressures on me, stuff you wouldn't understand.|But what about the villagers?! That ship looks like it's gonna blow up!
 Uh... maybe. I don't know. Maybe it won't blow up. I've seen 100 things weirder than a ship not blowing up.|Oh, Dad! I need to go shut it off!
 Okay, okay, wait! Wait.  If you're gonna turn it off, you gotta pull the heat dump toggle in the engine core. It was too snug for me to get to, and those little guys aren't strong enough. Hmm. Hey, I could wait for you. Maybe we could go into space together.|Why didn't you tell me about the heat dump in the first place?!
 I don't know... Wink!|Daaaaah! 
 What the—|Heat dump!  Too... stuck!
  Ohhhh, no. This is new to me. Mm... | 
  |Man, you know what's weird? That wasn't even a comet that crashed back there.  So, then, what was that dream about? I don't get my brain. Okay, when we get back to the tree house, let me do the talking.
 Bye.|Better get up here, Jake. It's about to happen.
 Coming! Just gotta get this cocoa pipin'.|Your loss, man. The Dap of the Heavens only happens every 20 years.  Oh, man. It's going down.
 Okay. Let's watch some stars.|Hmm. You missed it. It was honestly a little disappointing.
 Oh! Thank you, Princess. You are also killing.|You mean Flame Princess?
 Naw, man. What I heard didn't sound like her. Give me a peek on there. This is pretty much just a tube.  Huh. It's Lemongrab.|Uh, Lemongrab?! What's he up to at this time of night?
 Uh... it looks like he's headed for the Mountain of Matthew. I hear beaucoup spookoo legends about that place.|Beaucoup spookoo, you say? We should follow him.
 Huh? How come you care where Lemongrab goes?|He could, you know, he could be messing with crazy mystic power at that mountain. It's like seeing a baby playing with dynamite. Plus, seeing Flame Princess kind of messed me up. Now I gotta distract myself with work.
 Okay, okay. I feel you. Let's do some things. |There's his Lemon Camel. Lemongrease must be inside already.
 Whoa!|Huh? C'mon man!
  You gonna be okay by yourself?| Yeah, man.
  Aaaaaah! I am grease?!|Lemongrab, where you at?! Uh, cool.
 To reach me, you must choose correctly.|Who's that Matthew? Whuh-oh!
 Yummy! Ooh.|Yo. Dang. Finn Cakes. That's not fair.
 Pure essence! Eject!  Blorg! Bleject!|Lemongrab! Huh? Whoo!
 Lemongrab! Huh? Whoo!|Later, spirit bro.  Huh? What the heck am I running on? Oh, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Cool.  
 Later, spirit bro.  Huh? What the heck am I running on? Oh, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Cool.  |Lemongrab, you okay?!
 Hi, Finn.|"You're Matthew, huh?  Your rep precedes you, bro. ""Proceeds""?"
 What kind of rep?|Some stuff Jake said that I interpreted as negative.
 Well, ask yourself if that feels right.| What do you say, guy? 
 The meat bodies who've journeyed to this mountain have distilled themselves to their original source materials and  now exist in oneness.|Oneness? That's you, bro?
 I keep adding to myself until the second age of terror, when I will emerge in my final form and restore the world.|That's why you're here, L.G.? To merge with Matthew?
 It is one option, to know the ecstasy of my ego death.|Oh. Well, nice knowing you? I mean, I know you got issues. But you're, uh...
 I know.|Are you sure, though?
 These lemonjons are me, and I wonder if they can destroy you.|Ooh, boy. Lemongrab, hold up!
 If you are the head that blooms atop the ziggurat, then the stairs that lead to you must be infinite!|Careful with those metaphors, bro!
  Ohh. Aaaaah!|Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
 Aaaah!|Yo!
 Try it, grease! |Yes! Pow! Yeah! I got you, bro!
 Gol' ding!|Dude, I was gonna ask him to move.
 Thanks.|And for BMO... 
 So, Finn...  What are we waiting here for?|What? Dude, it's Super Porp Day.
 ♪Get down on that fizzy grape!♪|Yeah, yeah. That's the one.
 Man, this biz takes me back. I used to drink this stuff all the time when I was a kid.|What? That's not right. How could the exact same soda still be in production hundreds of years after the great Mushroom Wars?
  Okay, listen. So, okay, we could go track down the mysterious source of Super Porp. Do up a fuh-real, end up fightin' some big soda-computer-god-baby or whatever... We totally could. But... Super Porp is good. So why question this good thing, man? Why?|Hmm. Yeah, okay. Let's just go home.
 You want the can or the cup? |I like the can. 
  Hmm. I'd hate it if my kids didn't ever see each other...  Or if Viola shoved Jake Jr. down a dream hole.|I don't know. Jermaine's always been kind of a dream hole.
 We're all getting older. We should go see him now, or we might regret it.|Eh. It's not a great time just this minute.  Trying to figure this deal out.
 Woah!| Okay. Let's go see Jermaine.
  Okay. Let's go see Jermaine.|There's a lot more demons here than I remember.
 I want my yo-yo!|Yo, yo! That's rude, dude!
 Give me my cup!|Huh?
 Yipe!|Jake!
 Jake!|Woah!
 You guys can chill here 'till morning, when the demons thin out a little.| Whoo!
 Oh, Finn--Oh no! Instant regret!|Whoo! My house, my house!
  Instant regret!|Whoo! Remember, Jermaine? We did this when we wanted to make room for dessert!
 I don't care about that memory!|What?
 What?|Whoa--Ohh! Dang, my back.
 Okay, no more sleepover!|Oh no! Don't--don't kick us out!
 You're never gonna taste my carne asada, Bryce.| Dude, you can't live like this!
 Whoo-hoo! I've never even made fried rice before!  Get the plates.| Whoosh!
 To brothers! |It doesn't have to be weird, you guys!
 Sesame oil and salt. Salt is one of the five taste sensations.| Sweet, sour, bitter, umami and salty.
 But it'll look decent when I triple combo this bozo with this thing, right?|Like how?
 Cut his arms, Finn!|Okay!
 Dude, I never farted on the wing of a falcon. |Bros!
 I'm sick of bein' Daddy's watchdog.| This must've been building up for a while.
 Woah!|Wah!
 Wah!|Hand fire.
 Oh man. I've really built my own cage.|Guys, guys, guys!
 Guys, guys, guys!|This whole place is burning down!
 This whole place is burning down!|So if you're done being angry bonkers, let's work together!
 So if you're done being angry bonkers, let's work together!|Jermaine? You gonna leave me hanging, bro?
 Huh?!| But all of Dad's stuff!
  Ice cream!|I don't get it.
 Yeah. Dinner sounds great!  Yeah! Wait. The place where you eat dinner, does the moon shine through the window at night?|Sure.
 Well, now I'm a guy with these things on my head. I guess I'm just gonna roll with the punches.|Uh... Don't worry, man. I'm gonna pretend they're not even there.
 Maybe if I put a towel over my head they'll go to sleep. |Huh. What's on your head? I don't even notice it.
  Chips chips chips chips...| Why are you up so early?
  I got to get to the farmer's market before all the choice stuff is gone.|Oh. Why is BMO on your head?
 So, you want me to pick up any snacks?|Yeah, maybe some ketchup chips?
  Chips.|And...some kale  chips.
  Chips!|And some corn...  chips.
 Okay.  Later, dude.|Later.
  Ice cream!|
 Hush! Hush! Hush!  Noiseless, Chips!  Inaudible, Ice Cream!  Nyahah!| Aah! Quiet!  I thought I could just ignore them, but I can't! Chips and Ice Cream have to go!
 No! Those are my Chips and Ice Cream! By the light of the waxing moon, which was just unveiled by the parting clouds, transfer those two imps that have taken possession of Jake's ears to the head of the being who is watching from the window! Chips and Ice Cream!|BMO, it's happening!
 Noooo!|Whoa.
  It's Finn. Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a cliff diver!|What?!
 What?!| BMO, you got to let me dig this hole. It's important.
 A hole, you say?|Yeah. We beat this evil wizard, see, and we stole his giant wand.
 Rude!|This wand is crazy powerful, right? It's a thought cannon. It makes anything that you think of turn real.
 Up, please.|So it's too strong, so we're burying it for safety.
 I'm tired of your wisdom, BMO!  Now watch and learn! Yeah, okay, my name's Jake, and I'm gonna take this magic thought cannon, and I'm gonna think, I want a hole to bury this thought cannon in, and bobble, bobble, Jake gets a hole in which a thought cannon may be buried!|What if for a split second you think of something else?
 Whoops! Looks like I was thinking about a sandwich.  Enjoy your labor! Heh, heh, heh.|
 I'm home!  Who's going to have dinner with me tonight? Sorry fellas, i gotta go make some dreams come true. Where are we headed, dream token? Aha, ah Finn again.|Ahahahaha!
 Say Cheese!|Cheese!
 Ah, ungus!|Hello! Huh? Wait! Wait!
 Who's that? (pause) She's so beautiful! Buttfeathers!|Huh! The cosmic owl? Does that mean this dream is important? Is this a prophetic dream? And is this stuff all symbolic or literal?
 Huh? Sorry, but...|What does it all mean, boy?
 (in real word) I don't know, Shelby. I think it's too dark in there!|AHH!
 Pull 'im up, pull 'im up!|I think I just had a prophetic dream. Cosmic Owl was in it, he was acting all choco-loco.
 Finn, you gotta go back to sleep!|Huh?
 Cosmic owl dreams are important always! You gotta Go Back and find them again.|Yeah but last time I chased a cosmic owl dream I got dumped.
 Get back in there! It's too important! You don't got time on my class ring, or bets with Shelby, or Stomach fishing! Oop!|What?
 (shushes Finn)|(snoring)
 Alright let's do it! (Finn arrives back in his dream)|Hey! Cosmic Owl, you still here? Whoop!
 Whaaaaat?! You dillweeds! You're a dillweed, you're a dillweed's secretary, and you're probably some dillweed I've never met! You're three dillweeds being dillweeds, and you're going to dillweed this place into the ground! And you — |Princess! Princess! I don't know what a dillweed is.
 Whew! Starchy thought life would be better under the King of Ooo, but now there's even more stuff to sweep.  Poor old Starchy. Always getting the sweaty end of the lollipop.|Hey, Starchy. What are you doing — sweeping?
 Mm. Hey, is it me, or is getting purpler out here?|Oh, yeah. I think that's the catalyst comet. Guess it's getting pretty close or whatever.
 Getting close? Should we evacuate or...|What? No, no. It's cool, I think. It's just here to, like, shake things up, you know?It's okay. We've got sort of a — a relationship.
 Starch?|Eht.
 Shouldn't we try and calm them down?|Ehh, not after that whole knock-my-tower-over-onto-the-castle thing. A lot of guys got smooshed. They need to hear it from someone they really trust.
 Ehh, not after that whole knock-my-tower-over-onto-the-castle thing. A lot of guys got smooshed. They need to hear it from someone they really trust.|King of Ooo!
 King of Ooo!|King of Ooo?
 King of Ooo?|King of Ooo?
" Wait, are you saying ""King of Ooo""?"|What are you saying?
 Hey. You hear that?|Downstairs. King of Ooo? King of Ooo?
 What the —|It's that guy from before. He's mucking around with PB's ship — added all kinds of engines to it.
 Hey!|Hey, what do you think you're doing? PB don't let nobody touch her stuff — not even me, and I'm cool — least of all you, you sauce-tasting Brian-sniffer — whoa!
 |Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yeeh! Yeeh! Whoa! Uhhh!  No mercy, Jake.
   Aaaaah!|Hey, I'm back —  What the bing bong ping pong?! Gunther?!
 Hey, I'm back —  What the bing bong ping pong?! Gunther?!|What the king Kong sing song?! Whoaaaa — oof!
 That is my ship! But it looks like it's been modded out. That much engine power, it'll break through the atmosphere before I can do anything to stop it!  Finn and Jake! Yeah, get that guy!|My thorn!  I think we should go inside.
 Oof! |Gunther! What're you doing?!
  What am I doing? A fog shrouds my true intent, even from myself. There!  The Catalyst Comet! It all becomes clear. I am more than Gunther.  Like a mighty chrysalis pushing out of a damp cocoon—  —I emerge!|Jake! You okay?!
 Hey. Where's Glob?|Uh, I dunno.  He exploded in space.
 I'm Orgalorg.|Well, what the heck are you doing, Orgalorg?
 Ohhh, I know about open door philosophy!|What's that? You just say yes to stuff all the time?
 Pretty much.| That seems alright.
 It's all yours if you're willing to take it. Destroy worlds—  —crush anyone blocking the door. Feel their bones crumple and their goo spill out.|I don't like that at all.
 You can't stop me; I'm Orgalorg.| I'm pretty sure I can take you, bro.
 Not after I absorb the power and knowledge of that comet.| Absorb a triple salchow to your kneecaps!
  Absorb a triple salchow to your kneecaps!| Grab my hand!
 Shoot. Hey, stop drifting!|I'm not trying to!
 Ooh, maybe I can use jet propulsion!  Oh no, I can't breathe!|Jake, no! Don't worry, man, I'm working out a plan!  Freakin' bing-bong! Jake's gonna fulfill his croak dream after all! And that dirty umbrella is gonna enslave the universe!
  Cram, come on, this is gonna take forever.|Man, I'm gonna croak out here! Like a fish in the hands of a child! 
 Man, I'm gonna croak out here! Like a fish in the hands of a child! | Okay, Finn. Time to make an appeal to greater forces. 
 Hey, spaceman.|Wha—Dad?!
 Heh, this is so crazy, Finn! What're you doing out here?|Floating to my grave! Hurry up and save me!
 Can't, buddy—  —this baby does what it wants!|Are you kidding me?!
 See? I'm just  flying random-style.|It's not random! I merged my intention with the universe!
 You what?  Oh! Wait, I have an idea.|Really?
 Nah, it's cool, you got gloves on.|Oh, yeah. 
 You alright?| Yeah. Thanks, Dad.  Thanks, universe.
 Come again?| Oh! We gotta save Jake.  He's out there chokin' on gas!
" It's kinda fun, right? See, there's no reason, or purpose, or what you said, uh, ""universal intention.""  Look around, Finn. Empty crud. So empty."| I dunno, there's some stars and stuff.
  You're squeezed so tight, your bottom's gonna fall out. Put the phone down! |Put the phone down?
 Ye—  WHOO! What's going on, huh?| Look! The light of the comet!
 Ah!  That's pretty neat.  This moth is so bananas, man.|Bananas man... bananas man...
  Almost there...|That dude's gonna absorb the comet's mystical power and crush everybody. Who the heck raises guys like that? You think he had neglectful parents like you, or had he always been a no-good Orgalorg?
 Oh, gobslops, not Orgalorg!|Y-you know him?
 Ahaha, oh, yeah. |Snaps! He ate the comet!
 Snaps! He ate the comet!|I gotta stop him.
 It's too late, buddy; it's out of our hands.|Scronk that! I'm gonna use these hands—  —to sock him in the chops! In the chops!
 Scronk that! I'm gonna use these hands—  —to sock him in the chops! In the chops!|Aahh!
 Hey! Dinglord! In the name of—  the universe—  stop that!|
 | Grass Sword.
 |
  I didn't open this door!|Cool.
 Finn, do you remember?|Yeah, I-I think so. A long time ago—  —I was you, sorta. And I crashed on Earth. And became a butterfly or some biz.  And I guess—  it was just some random, absurd thing. Just a joke I've been playing out for centuries.
 Who's creating the joke? Are you? And, if so, then are you my creator?|Uh—maybe? I dunno. Probably not.
 Probably not, but who knows? I've been around forever and experienced so much impossible junk. I've embodied all that is good—and evil . And now we're here. It's unprecedented. And I give you a choice. Come with me to the end—and the beginning?  Or struggle here awhile like a beautiful autumn leaf.|What's that bell sound?
 This is your crisis. As you stand on the edge of freedom from|How long are you gonna list stuff?
 It's a long list.|You're tellin' me to abandon all this stuff—  —but you're not really making it sound bad.
 It's not bad. I'm just giving you the choice of a new mode of existence.|I feel like I put a lot of work into this meat reality. I'd like to see it through.
 Hey, how 'bout I get a new mode?|Are you seriously trying to bail out again?!
 What? This deal sounds pretty good!| Dad.
 Uh oh. I know that look.|When you fled the scene like a ding-dong ditcher in the night—
 Listen, Finn. No answer I give you will be satisfying. Besides, it was, like, 40 years ago.|I'm 16!
 I don't have a star to revolve around to track time.|But why do you always run from everything?!
  You burn enough bridges, the only direction to move is forward.| Hmm. Well, there ain't no changin' you, I guess.
 Goodbye, son!|Bye, Dad. Should've asked for a lift home.
 Bye, Dad. Should've asked for a lift home.|JAKE! I thought I had lost...... you... NO!
 You okay, Finn?| What? 
  What? |Jake?! Banana Man?! How?
 Well, I was just floatin' around, and I drifted into B-Man's flight path. Pretty random—  —right?|It wasn't random; I did it.
 Yeah—Whoa!  What's that?| Hey, PB! We took care of it.
  Joke's on you, man. We spent all our treasure the other day. Plus, don't even have any wives.|Wait, what? What about Lady?
 Lady's my girlfriend.|Wait, but...
 That was Tree Trunks.|Oh, yeah.
 But now your bravery is essential to a new heroic task! Can you guess what it is?|Uh...
 Come on. Guess!|Um... Fight a—Fight a dragon?
 Wrong! Follow me.| Man, this is stupid as heck. I miss PB.
 Yeah, yes...  I mean, except for this sweet armor, though. This armor is hot like fire.|Naw, the armor's stupid too.  Dang King of Ooo going around like DJ Snappy.
 This is it, fellas, the only spot in the kingdom left unscoured during my treasure census. I'm afraid it'll explode or something if I open it. But I really think there could, nay, there might be precious treasures in there. So I want you two to do it.|Man, this...seems like a really bad idea.
  Hey, eh, ooh, oh, ah.| Come on! Alright, alright.
 |Woah.
  Wait up.|It's a dragon...a candy dragon. Look. He sucks the vitamins from the roots. And transforms it into candy juice? And then—And then the juice goes in all those drains. This. This is the lifeblood of the whole kingdom. Power, defense, recreation. This is everything. It cleans, it nourishes, and—and...
 ♪Muh-muh-muh money, money.♪ Go on...|What are you talking about with all this money talk?
 Look, everyone needs juice to live, right? And I control the source of the juice, so by me charging a mere pittance for every single drop, I can easily quadruple my treasure pile!|Man, if you think we're just gonna stand here and let...
 Oh, hey boys!|Princess, sklizz is really blizzed up with the King of Ooo! He really blizzed up all the sklizz.
 Yeah, well maybe he should unblizz it then.  Why do I always gotta unblizz everything?|But Princess, under the tree there's—there's a dragon. And he took the juice!
  Oh no. This is all my fault. Neddy...|Princess? Princess, what is it?
 | Whaaaaaaaaa?
  Woah.  Ahhhhhhh.| It's pretty quiet, huh?
 I don't think we can. He's a giant.| Yup.
  This armor is driving me nuts!|No way, I changed my mind. I feel like a fancy shield. Or if I was like a dangerous candlestick. Like a knight's candlestick.
 You don't stretch, man. This thing's cramping my crimps!  Woo!|Dude, I don't like that.
 Eh, garden stuff, I guess.|Ummm... Hey Bonnie, you always act like a loner, right? But next to your brother, you're the light of the party. Sorry, the LIGHT of the party.
 People get built different. We don't need to figure it out. We just need to respect it. Maybe he likes his own company better than I like mine.|Well, do you miss the candy people?
  There. Right there. See?| Uhhh...Yeah. It's a small thing?
 Okay, but why, though?|Yeah, we're curious.
 See? Don't fail on this one, boys.  Don't you dare fail me.| Actually, I'm kinda glad we're walking in this direction. We never walk in this direction.
  Hey, how long do you think capturin' a flyin' mushroom takes?| Well we gotta find one first. 
 Yeah, that too. How long?| Mm. An hour to capture, aaand, if we don't find him by dinner, we'll tell KOO to send out a Banana Guard patrol.
 Tell who?|KOO.
 ...King Of Ooo?|Yeah.
 |Did you notice he was wearing Princess Bubblegum's clothes?
 Yeah, that was sorta cool. But you know, PB just left her kingdom to 'im. And all her stuff, so what's that about?|Hmm.
 |Yeah, good job, Jake.
 Check it out.  Big enough for KOO's tiny heiny!|Yeah, the only thing, though, is it's not flying.
 Mmm, yeah... |I guess we could just sit here... and wait for it to fly?
 Well, I've heard enough. Come on, Finn. Let's go arrest Marceline.|Wait a minute. We don't even know if Marceline did this.
 That's right. I forgot about Ooo's extensive vampire community.  Come on!|Yeah, but we need to conduct a proper investigation.
 I know that. Ain't no rookie.|All right, come on. I'll let you be bad cop.
 Yeah!|Hey, man, that's not right. Marceline's our friend.
 Physical contact! Officer resisting arrest! Boom!|Ow!
 We don't know yet. So just chill. Oh, hey, guys. How you doing?|Jake did excessive force on me.
 I'm sorry.  Let me kiss it! | Ew! Ew!
 You want proof? Look. |Whoa!
 Proof of how off I'm gonna go if you don't confess.|Yo, chill, Jake.
 I'm wilin' out!|Listen, Marci, I can barely control this guy, and the villagers are getting crazy. They want to run you over with a wagon, and I'm offering you a way out.
 Finn, be real for a second.|All right.
 Look into my eyes, man. I didn't do it.|To be honest, it looks like you're not sure if you did it.
 Dream stuff always means something.|We'll figure this out, Marci, together. We promise.
"  Woof. I can barely stand up. Look at this. It's my new dance. It's called ""I got arthritis."" Ohh. The end."|You should have hung back with P.B.
 But I've got a bad feeling like you guys are gonna die without me.|Dang, Marci. Have some faith. Geez.
 Moo!  |Get it!  You see it?
 No. But what's that?|Must be its filthy lair.  What's wrong?
 Remember how I said my fear of vampires was based on ignorance?|Yeah.
 Well, I think that revelation was actually based on true ignorance.|So you're scared of vampires again?
 Yeah, man, don't be ignorant.|Come on.
 Okay, but I'm gonna hold on to your shirt.|Look at these poor babies. What's happening to them?
 Moo.|I think they're in the process of being turned, eh?
 Ugh, glob. Something big just dropped in my gut.|Hang in there, bro.
 I can't be here, man. It's too real.|Wait, you hear that? Listen.  There!
  A little help.| Jake!  Hey, get back here!  Dang! Lost him! Marci? Hey, Marci, you still out here?
 She's still out here, all right.|Oh, hey, man. Did you see a scary beast go by? I chased it out here, but it got away.
 Oh, we found that beast, and we took care of her real nice You vampire hugger!|Wait, what?
 Lookum yonder.|What the blood?
  Now look at the other yonder.|Huh? Oh, fudge! You're sick, man! What's wrong with you?
 What? I'm the good guy here.|You're gonna explode my friend.
 Oh, flip, you're right. This is way messed up. Run, Finn! You got to beat the sun!  Go, Finn! Go!|Aaaaaaah! Marceline, nooooo!
 What?! No! I'm cured! It is weird though that it's happening at about the same time I got un-gunked. I gotta go see Bonnie. Ow! Oh yeah, guess I'm walkin'. No mo' powers.|Didn't your daddy give you demon powers?
 Wow.|Look, Jake, a two-pronged stake And a stake boomerang.
 The cave is totally empty. No sign of anyone.|Phew!
 Nothing going on out here either. Maybe we should all fan out Look for tracks.|Or clues.
 Don't worry about us, Marceline.|Yeah, we're ready for anything.
 Can't smell nuthin' no more. Ugh! Ahh. Crud.|Whoops.
 Vampiyah, I'm gonna kick yah Vampiyah, I'm gonna lick yah Vampiyah Aah! Uh-oh. It's P.B.'s outside clock!|Ahh. You did a tremendous job guarding the cabin, Jake. But it looks like you need to be relieved.
 Yeah, I need relief. P.B. still working on new vampire-busting gear?|Yeah, but she's almost done. No sign of Marceline, though. I think she ditched us to fight the vampires by herself. Solo-style. We'll go look for her after P.B.'s device is up and running. So, how did you pass the time?
 Patted my laps and made some rhymes. Stoop, stoop, sittin' on the stoop Stoop, stoop, sittin' on the stoop|Is that P.B.'s outside clock? Looks like it's been staked. What did you do?
 I heard a loud snap, and my vampire-hunting reflexes kicked in!|Dude, that was her Uncle Gumbald's outside clock.
 Other|Aaah! What was that?! Vampiyah! Aah! Aah! Hyah! Hah!
 Other|Eh! Stake! Yeah!
 Finn?|I got your back, Marceline! Ha! Huh?
 Ow. How dare you stake my back?|I was aiming for your heart!
 Other|Aaaaaah! No way! Waaaaaaah!
 Other|Shmowzow.
 and you still can't get anything right, can you?|Here's our chance!
 Other|Come on, Simon. It's over.  It's gonna be okay, man. Nope, nope. This way. This way. Come on, let's get you some ice cream.
 Cut it out! That's not helping her.|But Mom and Dad always burped on us.
" Pride... hmm. Do you guys know what ""hubris"" is?"|It's like an old-timey deity who weighed your deeds on a scale.
 That's like you, PB.|Dude.
 That ain't true, PB. Marcy took a risk, and you helped her because you're her friend. Real friends take each other to the edge of death—'cause death is life! Right, Finn?|Shoot, yeah! I get poisoned all the time just doing the dishes!
 Well, let's get our butts over there then! Find The Moon, Finn. We'll work on an antidote. You guys take her back to the poison lab. Maybe we can extract her healing powers.|Word!
 |Moon pearls... We're on her trail.
 Gross!|I think they're pretty.
 What if they're, like, her boogers... or worse?|Come on, Jake.
 Ew, ew, ew, ew! Sometimes I think vampires were invented just to torment me.|Whoa. I don't think so, man. I think you might have a hubrits.
 I'm just saying it's a possibility.|Hey, look! The moon's pontoon.
 See?! I hate it! What it this, some hut the Moon plopped out of her bod?|I don't think so. This mummy job looks like it used to belong to that mummy job.
 Shouldn't she, like, explode or something?|She just healted that sword right out of her bod! Let's try frying her up in the sun.
 How are we supposed to destroy this stay-fresh creep?|Hmm. Let's stick with P.B.'s plan and try staking her a bunch of different ways.
 Man, we've been doing this for hours.|You know, it's weird that P.B. wanted us to stake her back, instead of us taking her back.
" Wait. ""Taking"" or ""staking""? She said ""you guys, 'sztake' her back."|""" No, yeah! She said, ""you guys, take her back."
" "" So which one should we do?"|Both, I guess. We'd better hurry before she wakes up at sundown.
 Whoops. Get her back in the vase!|Come get us, blood bucket!
 What?!|Run!
 Run!|Here she come!
 Dude, for real, why'd you make her chase us?|"Marci needs her healing powers. ""Stake her back"" to the castle, bro!"
 Shoot, just don't let her near my deli tray!|Well, run harder, dude!
 Okay.|Man, she is really booking it hard! You see that, Jake?
 No, bro, just let me run!|Holy stink! She's smiling right at me!
 I don't need a play-by-play, man!|She's messing with us.
 What do you mean?!|I mean she's not catching up on purpose!
 Why do you think that?|She's giving me this look... Slow down so I can talk to her.
 No, boy, you crazy!|Just do it! I won't let her bite you!
 Okay, my life is in your hands, man!|Hey. We're leading you to a trap. We're gonna suck out your healing power and dust you. And then I'm gonna put your dust in a litter box. And get a tiger to drop a huge smelly tiger bomb on your sorry dust clumps!
 How can you lead me when I am your guide?|Are you being literal or allegorical?  Me no like! Run, Jake, run!
 But she said I'm running in her light!|Who gives a donk?! Just go!
 You guys.|We brought The Moon!
 Hold her off till Marci wakes up!|She's not doing anything.
 You gonna try something?|Okay, I guess. Whoops!
 What was that?!|I don't know, man, I think I just got tapped out!
 Pigs!|She's doing something weird! Jake, help!
 I can't! I feel like I'm in a slow-motion terror dream!|Banana Guards, help!
 Banana Guards, help!|Princess, I can't stop her!
 You kind of have to, Finn!|Rats! Okay, let me get my sword.
 Finn.|Yes!
 Finn, she's dead.|Oh, thank glob.
 Will you calm down and listen to-|YAHHH! 
 YAHHH! | Shoot.
 I think I wanna-|Roll out!  Thorn arm!  ACTIVATE!
 Roll out!  Thorn arm!  ACTIVATE!| You gonna help, or what?
  Let me finish my thought.| Stake you!  Okay, go ahead.
  YAHHHH!  FINN! What the heck?!|It's against my code to strike a foe who's raised his bottom to the sky. The Enchiridion explicitly states so.
 Dem are your rules.|Dem a good rule dhough.
 Outta my way!|Ep, ep, ep, ep, ep! Look.  Look at these babies. These pleadin' puppies.
 Ep, ep, ep, ep, ep! Look.  Look at these babies. These pleadin' puppies.|Whoops. Shoulda staked him.
 Hold that thought! | Finish him! Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam-
 Finn, you can stop.|Oh, okay, now we're stopping.  Sorry, dude.
  It's chill.  See? No funny business.| Hey, Jake.
  What?|" ""PB says she's gonna set her vampire sucking machine to full blast if he tries anything funny."""
"  ""What does full blast even mean?"""|" ""I guess it means he'll explode to dust."""
"  ""Mouth fart code is for emergencies only."""|" ""Sorry!"""
 Finn, don't worry about it. We've got bigger fish to fry right now.|But...
 ...DJ Fresh-Start, and my boy Big Trace.|You sure you're not coming, Marceline? We could really use your help. Marceline? Okay, maybe later then.
 And instead of a wax idol, they shall have a true princess... Wrought of iron, with teeth of diamonds. Her heart is ice! Her will is fire! Princess Crunchy, the unforgiving!  Go fight that thing for me!|Whoa!
 Finn, this ain't workin'. It's just fart grabbin'.|Yeah, but what else can we do?
 Marceline?|Marceline?
 Sorry, what?|I was just saying we stocked your fridge with lipstick and stuff, so you'll have lots to eat.
 No, I think I need to ruminate a little—think about being a vampire again.|"Are you, uh... Do you feel bad? I don't want to say, like, ""I'm sorry about who you are"" or anything if you're feeling okay, but I don't know how bad news all of this is... Right?"
 Nah, I'm cool being a vampire again. Being mortal was good... At the same time, it was terrifying. Now I'm a vampire with fresh mortal memories and—I don't know—more empathy or something... More grown-up. Bonnie, thank you for helping me grow up. Now, I guess we get to hang out together forever.|Take care!
 Well, I suppose. But you don't got to be so technical about it.|Listen, all I'm saying is we—
 Listen, all I'm saying is we—|Hello?
" Hey, it's me. Is there a big rainbow over your house right now spelling out ""Happy birthday, BMO""?"|No. Actually, it's snowing like crazy.
 I got to stay here to fix this thing. Tell BMO I'm sorry I missed the party.|That's okay. BMO doesn't care any—
 That's okay. BMO doesn't care any—|BMO only cares about one special guest.
 Hey, Moe! New haircut?|Whoa, Moe! What happened to your body?
 Well, we made a cake.|We weren't sure if you eat, but BMO insisted.
 Wow.|Hmm, I don't know. Sounds kind of dangerous.
 Air? Are you there, Air? It's me -- BMO.  I know it's been a long time since we talked. Sorry about that. But, well, maybe if you don't want to talk, you could just listen. Moe told me if I do this thing, I'll be a grown-up, and that sounds cool, I guess.  Like, if I was grown, then I could drive to the playground all by myself.  And I could buy my own pacifiers at the store, if I was grown.  But then, if I change, will Finn and Jake still love me?  Will I still love them?  Moe changed into a new body...  and he's still the same, I guess, sort of.  But does growing up just change your body, or also your soul?  Maybe I could just stay the same forever.|So...
 So!|Um... Yeah, it's nice to see you, Moe.
 Yeah, you too.|Uh... So, Moe, do you want to... uh... Jake?
  Oh, hey, I'm on my way. One sec.|Um, hold on, Moe.  Jake, what are you doing?
 Finn, all this is heck of awkward without BMO -- way more awkward than I thought it'd be. I think maybe I don't like old people. They make me feel like I'm gonna get old one day, too. I'm just gonna stay in this cup for a bit. I'll be out later. | You can't do that, it's rude. And what about Princess Bubblegum? She's way old, and you like her.
 Yeah, but she listens to music. Moe probably only, like, listens to the sound of the earth decaying.| Come on, you're being weird.  Hey, sorry about that, Moe.
 Oh! |Classic!
  This is horseplay! Stop it!  We need to go inside and do what I want to do!|Oh. O-okay. If -- if you want.
 |That sounds griz as nuts!
 Do you boys want to play again?|
 Also, I'm lighter than you know.|I'm sorry we didn't find any hangmen.
 Ah, bloo-hoo.|Moe! 
 Bandits stole my legs!| Yeesh.
 If you tell us where the bandits went, we'll avenge your legs!|We're sorry we left you!
 You should be. I'm your Gwampa wobot. Carry me.  Over here.  There! There's the thief!  The thief with my legs!|Neptr?
 Throw him out! |Come on. Maybe Neptr did it like, accidentally?
  Neptr's out cold. He's got a heck of a dent on his head.|What? Who could have done that?
 Forget him! You love me, right? You love me like BMO?|What? You're all right, but we -- we love BMO.
 BMO's trash!|Moe!
  Moe's dead! |"""Ah-mo""?"
 Ow!|Aah!
 BMO! |Hey.  We caught the tail end of what happened. Are you okay?
 I don't think I can. I'm not grown up -- or I'm too grown up now. I think I just killed someone. I need to have some time alone, but you're all really nice.|All right.
 Unchecked.|Finn and Jake's treehouse?
 Mm-hmm.|Who are you, and why do you want to get revenge?
 I... Am... Me-Mow!|Me-Mow?! Whoa.
 Me-Mow?! Whoa.|You've gotten bigger.
 This prison cell's not going to hold me.|Oh?
 Hey, Finn and Jake! I'll get my revenge! You hear me?! Revenge!|Hey, BMO, are you sure you took down all the wanted posters?
 Stick 'em up.|Huh?
 Yaah!|Thanks, BMO.
 Why don't we call, like child services? Or an exterminator?|This is gonna work. Just trust me, a'ight?
 Ugh.|Do as I do.
 Do as I do.|Boy, I just love walking through our delightfully not-creepy doorway. Don't you, Jake?
 Uh-huh, uh-huh. |Walking through the not-creepy air to my not-creepy couch, sitting on my not-creepy butt.
 Your butt is kinda creepy.|I say 'creepy' is just another label we use to distance ourselves from stuff we don't understand. Or that it reminds us of something in ourselves that we're not comfortable with. I mean, it just ain't an actual thing, you know? Unless you choose to believe it. Right, Jake?
 Other|Ice King?!
 Where is he?!|Jake? He's right there.
 Other|Who are you talking about?
 Other|Ice King, we didn't take Gunter.
 Other|What makes you think we took him?
 Other|Wait, what?
 Other|Hey, Jake, do you think you could, like, turn into a little Gunter and go over to him?
 That's gonna be kind of weird.|Yeah, but it'll calm him down, so
 Other|You want to try telling us what happened?
 Other|What do you think, Jake? Should we check out the ice kingdom for clues?
 Hey look how dumb I am in that world. Here's me. Woof woof woof! Hahahahaha! I eat stuff off the ground. I don't know, what are dogs even into these days?|Wow, everything sucks here!
 Finn, look!|Oh jeez, this looks pretty real.  He's got the Enchiridion!  And, wait, is that Billy? Why is he so tiny?
  WOOHOO! HAHAHAHAHAHA!  Yeah, just hang out there for a while! I love it! I feel fresh, hahahahahaha!| Well, this is the weirdest thing I've ever done. 
 Woah!  Oof!|Hey, Prismo's calling!
  OOOOOO!|TION!
 Don't sweat it, boy! Finn and I got yo' back!| Who's bullying you Prismo?!
 Nobody's bullying me. Look, um, remember when you wished the lich never existed and you created a new wish reality that ended up totally not working out?|No.
 Vaguely, yes.|What?
 You don't remember making that wish!|Wu-huh?
 Dude, I'll catch you up.  Look!  After you wished the lich never existed, you accidentally created an alternate wish reality where magic doesn't really exist.|Wait! . Who's that dude?
 That's you! But sort of less cool.|Uh-huh, proceed.
 So you find an old Marceline and the crown on the body of Ice King's skeleton who was smushed under the weight of a frozen mitogenic bomb. But then the destiny gang steals your family donkey, so you use the crown to become Ice Finn and save your donkey and your family. But, the crown makes you crazy, and you ice everything up like a dumb bozo, which sets off the mitogenic bomb, which releases the spirit of the lich anyway. But then, this reality's Jake made a counter wish which supposedly fixed the problem, but as it turned out, it didn't really.|Can I just say that I don't remember any of this stuff.
 Because technically it didn't happen to you. But, also it still happened, and that wish reality continues to exist.|Is this why all of a sudden one day I was better at the flute.
 Listen! Something, really bad, is about to go down.  Ice Finn is using his world's Enchiridion to build a portal to the multiverse. I literally do not know what will happen if he succeeds, but it could def's be catastrophic to the architecture of these realities. Now if that happens, my boss, let me repeat that, my BOSS will hold ME responsible, and by proxy, y'all both be in the dip too.|Why don't you just bloop bloop it all better?
  His boss! Who's that?|Alright, man, what do we do? 
 Take this, and use it to take care of the Ice Finn.|Oh, wait what do you mean by take care o-
 Good luck guys we're all depending on you! | Woah.
 What is it?| Oh golly!
  What's that thing now?|It's like 50 bowling balls on my teen bod! Oh, check it! There's instructions.  The maid will handle all Class A interdimensional Bung-ups if you follow these simple steps
 Lower it!|Ledge ledge ledge!  Ok! Focus my intention. 
 Just a few more jewels before I can open the portal to a better world!|My intention to heal the madness of this other self.
 Wait, wait, wait. I don't think that's what we're supposed to do. Prismo said take care of him.|Yeah, that means make him feel better.
 Are you being stupid on purpose?|Yeah, but dude, that is me!
 I heard you the first time!|There's gotta be something else we can do.
 Bro, you heard Prismo, we don't have a choice.| Ok, but you do it! I just can't man i- it's too messed up.
 Alright, you're right. Shut your eyes and cover your ears!| Mamamamamamama.
  Oh, flip!|Mamamamama-
 hey, hey!|Did you do it?
 Nah man! Let's just go steal the Enchiridion.|Woah yeah! That way he can't open the portal and nobody gets obliterated!  That should work!
  It's gonna be so great in the next place, guys! It's like we're spinning, spinning, spinning into the new land!  Hahahahahahahaha! Woohoo! Hahahahaha! | Sneaky fashion! 
 Finn, I love you! Just in case we eat it fighting this guy.|Oh, yeah, I love you too.
 Hey, what's up?|I'll get you out of this, Billy!
  It's Bobby.  Look out!| Who's that?
  Jewels! |What's wrong with him? He looks possessed or somethi-  ooh, boy, here we go!
  Big D's mind is back! Wooo!  I must escape, first try! | Uhhhh!
  What are you doing!? |Woah! 
 Traitor! |Jake, let's book it! 
 Huh, what the? |JAKE! Woah, what the?  AHHHHHHHH! 
  YES! The frost! | Dude, don't kill him!  That's me, kinda. Other Finn, just listen at me. Your name is Finn Mertens! You're best friend is Jake the dog! You have a birthmark like a flaming sideways teardrop! In, like, a really weird place!
 What? What's going on? Bartrum?|Yeah, yeah! Your whole thing is you wanna help people, remember? We can fix all this.
  It's like the most evil heartburn!|JAAAAKE! Get out of the way! . A man needs a maid, a man needs a maid, a man needs a maid!
 You're Welcome! Ha, I don't know what he's saying. Let's bounce. |Prismo, wait!  We have so much to talk about . Oh. Prismo, I'm sorry if this is breaking the rules but you gotta help this guy out. He's just always gonna be messed up with that crown around. 
 D'aaawwwww!|Huh, that's his family.
 No, it wasn't.| Sure it was. Anyway, Flambo's brother's map says the weird cave should be like, right over... Ah! It's right here.  Come on, Jake.
 Okay, hold on. Let me get out my sidewalk chalk. I want to write all over the walls in there.|What? You can't use that stuff in here. This is like an ancient, sacred temple.
 What? You can't use that stuff in here. This is like an ancient, sacred temple.|Oh, well, now, that's just great. You don't put traps in the foyer! The foyer is a safe space. Man, not even Jake could smash through this mess. But maybe there's a back door or something.
 Oh, well, now, that's just great. You don't put traps in the foyer! The foyer is a safe space. Man, not even Jake could smash through this mess. But maybe there's a back door or something.|Uh oh! Options. Better leave a little trail in case I get lost. Bread-crumb style. Plus, for if Jake gets in and tries to track me down. Too bad I don't still have that sidewalk ch... Oh!
 Uh oh! Options. Better leave a little trail in case I get lost. Bread-crumb style. Plus, for if Jake gets in and tries to track me down. Too bad I don't still have that sidewalk ch... Oh!|Okay, well, scratch that. Now I really hope there's another way out.
 Okay, well, scratch that. Now I really hope there's another way out.|Hall of Egress. Egress, egress.
 Hall of Egress. Egress, egress.| What's 'egress' mean?
  Exit.|Egress means exit!
 Egress means exit!|Great. What am I supposed to do now? 
 Great. What am I supposed to do now? |Wait. Hey. Hey, I just smashed you. I... Ah... Magic door, okay. Right, but if I...
 Wait. Hey. Hey, I just smashed you. I... Ah... Magic door, okay. Right, but if I...|Well done, Finn. You solved the magic door. That ought to have done it, and... Oh. This door is too tricky for me. Guess I better give up, right? Wrong, wrong! Let's try that again.
 Well done, Finn. You solved the magic door. That ought to have done it, and... Oh. This door is too tricky for me. Guess I better give up, right? Wrong, wrong! Let's try that again.|Hmm. Smooth like metal. Floor's smooth too. What have we here? An errant thread!  It must lead back out. Bread-crumb... Oh, trap door?  Spike trap. Better head back and regroup.
 Hmm. Smooth like metal. Floor's smooth too. What have we here? An errant thread!  It must lead back out. Bread-crumb... Oh, trap door?  Spike trap. Better head back and regroup.|Fiendish. Anyway, don't let's do that again.
 Fiendish. Anyway, don't let's do that again.|And right then straight. And... Hey now. Hold the phone, there should be a left turn here. Letters? E... G... 'Egress'. It spells 'egress'. This way! And here's another one, and another...  Whoa!
 And right then straight. And... Hey now. Hold the phone, there should be a left turn here. Letters? E... G... 'Egress'. It spells 'egress'. This way! And here's another one, and another...  Whoa!|Okay. So, every map I make is wrong. All the exit signs led to traps. Plus the braille, the hieroglyphics, and the tape recorder message too. It's  almost like the maze is trying to tell me something. Something confusing, whatever! Who needs anyway with your stupid signs and messages? I'm Finn Mertens, ya heard? And I don't need no nothing! Watch me. 
 Finn? Fi-inn!|Jake! Jake, I'm coming!
 Finn? Where are ya, buddy?|Jake!
 Jake!|That's a little disappointing. Still, though. I'm in the homestretch here.
 That's a little disappointing. Still, though. I'm in the homestretch here.|Jake!
 Finn! There you are.|Yeah. Sorry to pop up, then disappear again like that.
 Again? You just got here, son.|I did? Shoot, man. This cave has got me straight scrambled up and down.
 What cave?|What? Oh. Uh oh.
 What? Oh. Uh oh.|Well?
 Well, I followed your map, but there's just a bunch of grass here.|What? Let me see! 
 What? Let me see! |Dang it.
 Dang it.|So, yeah. Everything I did to try to make sense of the maze or to play it safe totally backfired, but when I got fed up, and started just charging in willy-nilly, I was able to get to the end and find you.
 And then the whole thing disappeared. But I wonder how come I don't remember any of it.|I don't know. I'm just hoping, maybe if I sleep it off, maybe I'll be better in the morning.
 Okay, well... Good night, buddy.|Thanks, Jake. Good night.
 Are you awake?|Yes.
 Are you gonna open your eyes now?|Maybe.
 Are you scared?|No.
 Then do it.|On three.
 So, been almost a month now. What do you think? You wanna try opening 'em? It's beautiful day. Plus, I need someone to tell me if this hat looks cool.|Man I told you. If I open 'em now, it'll just be the same. I got to wait till something's different.
 Yeah, that makes sense, I guess. So, um, I got you a little something, a little present.|Wow, thanks man!
 You're really gonna thank me. Gotcha!|No!
 No!|Yeah, you've done it, like, 30 times now.
 Yeah, you've done it, like, 30 times now.|It's like programmed into your DNA or something.
 Well, shoot, man. If I wanna do it that bad, it must be kinda right, right?|
 Look at it from where I'm sitting. All this funky pizzazz that only you can see, that's like the literal definition of a hallucination, either all that stuff is a dream or like, I'm a dream. And I ain't no dream, ya heard?|Yeah, I know, I heard. It's just that, well...
 Hyah! Open up!|Oh, Jake, I know you mean well, but I guess I got to see this one through on my own.  I'll see you around, buddy.
 Oh, Jake, I know you mean well, but I guess I got to see this one through on my own.  I'll see you around, buddy.|Huh? What the... How long has this been going on? Someone's apt to track me down, bread-crumb style, e.g. Jake. Can't let him catch me. No more threads to follow. No more egress.
 Huh? What the... How long has this been going on? Someone's apt to track me down, bread-crumb style, e.g. Jake. Can't let him catch me. No more threads to follow. No more egress.|Hmm. It's cool in here... Ain't nothing wrong with that. Deep too. That's good. Ain't nobody gonna be looking for me down. Ugh!  Egress! Egress! Egress! Egress!
 Whoa! That must have been some cave!|No comment!
 Dude.| Oh, hi, Jake. What are you doing here?
 I wanted to check out your new lady friend, but I guess she just dumped you like a diaper in the dirt, bro.  I'm sorry, man! I want you to have a healthy relationship with someone cool.|That's so sweet, Jake. I love you, man.
 Me, too, man. Okay, I'm okay.|But, dude, me and Huntress Wizard weren't together. We're just trying to conjure up the Spirit of the Forest with my flute spell.
 What the blood are you talking about?|It went down like this.
 It went down like this.|I was just minding my own business, in my new alone place I've been hanging out at.
 I was just minding my own business, in my new alone place I've been hanging out at.|Hello.
 How are you playing like that?|I don't know. I'm just making stuff up.
 Something in your notes has the quality of a powerful evocation spell. What spirit guides your hands? Tell me, or I'll put this up your nose.|First off, I'm a great fighter. And especially agile when I'm nude, so good luck. Second, my flute improv ain't no secret. I let my grass hand do whatever it wants, which is usually sort of shreddy and busy.
 Looking for a dope boyfriend.|No man. She thinks my grass arm flute playing could summon the Spirit of the Forest. I've been playing different songs for 2 weeks, though, and he hasn't shown up yet.
 Who's that, her ex-boyfriend?|Uh, I guess they used to hang out, but maybe in some kind of mentor-student capacity.
 So my theory holds. You can still make this happen.|Yeah, I really want to help her summon this dude.
 Finn, that's not why you're here.|That's why I'm here.
 Come on. Let's make some magic happen.|Yeah, my magic flute spell.
 I think the problem is your flute. We should make you a better one from a magical tusk, like the tusk of the legendary Thunder Boar that lives in these woods.|I'm down for whatever if it helps.
 Ha-ha! I'm like your sleepover chaperone.|Grow up.
 Dude, I think I figured it out. You can't summon the Spirit of the Forest 'cause you ain't playing that flute for him. You got a crush on HW.|HW's just training me to live an ascetic life like her.
 Before we hunt the Thunder Boar, you should drink from this enchanted spring. It might give you crazy dreams, but when you wake up, you'll be immune to the Boar's electrical attacks.|Let's roll those dice.
 Hey, dude, are you sure you wanna do that?|I've had plenty of weird dreams... Oh-okay! That was fast.
 Welcome. I am the Spirit of the Forest.|Wow, dude, we've been trying to summon you for weeks.
 And why do you seek me?|I don't, personally, but Huntress Wizard really wants to talk to you, man.
 Did you know that a wolf's eyes are on the front of its head?|But, yeah, didn't you guys used to hang?
 Most predatory species are like that. This little buddy doesn't even know I'm here.|Fella, I don't want to have a science talk right now.
 Huntress Wizard only sees straight ahead, eyes on the prize. Now, why did you really need to see me?|Oh, yeah! Can you make me immune to electricity?
  Here.|Whoa.
 Now plunge that into your heart.|And this will give me immunity to electricity?
 And this will give me immunity to electricity?|I'll do it. To help Huntress Wizard.
 I'll do it. To help Huntress Wizard.|How long was I out?
 Hold still.|Yeah, fells fine.
 Great. Now we can hunt down the Thunder Boar.|Oh, yeah, the Boar.
 Mostly, Finn, but also some kind of giant wild pig.|There!
 There!|Jake's joking. I smell fine.
 You just wanted a tusk? You could have asked!|Oh.
 You can stop. He is not coming. He is gone for good, and I should just deal.|Maybe if I played it a little jazzier, like, all syncopated?
 Finn, who was your flute spell for?|Um... I was playing my flute for you the whole time, but I knew you had a thing with this dude, and he seems cool, so I was just gonna keep playing this flute song about my secret feelings until my flute broke.
 Fear of softness is waht drove me to the mad and sad world of wizarding. And Finn...|Yeah, what?
 Uh, that's real dumb.|I agree.
 Wait, you agree with me or her?|Take it easy, Huntress Wizard.
 Take it easy, Huntress Wizard.|Man, I can't believe all you can do is upgrade your armor in this game.
 It's all about patience and treating each grueling repetitive battle as if it were your first.|Oh, snap! Finally!
 Whoo! Blah!|What a bad and boring game. It was just what I needed.
 I'm sorry it didn't work out with Huntress Wizard. She just needs time to miss how cool you are.|Attracting forces come and go, man.
 Ha, that's a dumb story; I love dumb stories! What would you change about yourself if you got that treasure? Fix your weird cursed grass arm so it wouldn't be weird and cursed?|Nah. I'd like to be taller.
 How tall we talking about?|I don't know. Like, couple of inches. Say...tall as Princess Bubblegum?
  Oh, I see.|Jake, how would you change yourself on Dead Mountain if only the legends were true?
  I wouldn't change anything; I'm the whole package.  Whoa!| Hey! There's a big warning about Dead Mountain in here. See?  It says some kind of evil hermit guards the mountaintop.  'Don't let him look at you or something horrible will happen.' That seals the deal. The twin temptations of getting to grow a couple of inches and battling an evil hermit sound like a pretty perfect day. Let's go!
 Shh!| Let's go.
  Gear up for battle! You smell like cattle! Gear up for battle! You smell... Like cattle!|Monsters that get you by looking at you are so doomb.
 Everybody knows all you need is a mirror.|They ought to get a new gimmick.  There's the evil hermit's uh... what is that? A hut?
 Yah! Rats!| Is that the hermit?  We don't get to fight the hermit.
 Hey look.|What is it, boy?
 The treasure. Okay, here it goes.  Oh great treasure, make my taste buds think they're tasting fried chicken even when I eat my fruits and vegetables. I don't have any fruits or vegetables on me. I guess I'll find out later if that worked. Your turn.| Oh great treasure, I want to be approximately 11.5 inches taller.  Gross! It's leaking! 
 This place is depressing.|And I'm not growing taller. There's nothing going on here. ON TOP OF DEAD MOUNTAIN!
 We should have known better than to trust a book.|Yeah. He makes one cool skeleton, though.  These shades...  Let me check out these shades.  Aah! Ohh!
 Finn!|Huh? Jake?
 You're awake! Oh, I was so worried. I've been waiting with a bowl of soup. It has hoops and loops and maybe some goop.| What happened? I don't remember getting into bed.
 Don't worry. You're gonna be fine...  in no time.|Thanks for taking care of me. You're the greatest big brother ever.  W-Why are you doing that?
 You're awake! You want some tea? Or saltine crackers?|BMO, you're my little angel.
 I'm a real boy!  With wings!  And a halo!  Oh!|What's happening?
 I don't know but it probably has something to do with your weird old eyes.| Something is wrong with my eyes?
  Something is wrong with my eyes?|Aah! Hermit eyes! Dead-hermit eyes!
 Heh, it's fine.|Do you think the hermit did this... to punish me for grabbing his shades?
 I think maybe the eyes are the treasure.|So, then, am I making people what they want to be?
 You're a nerd.|I don't know, maybe. Is that bad?
  What to wear for my speech...  Boss next door or hot president?|Is this what you needed help with?
 No, I think I got this. Oh! Hi Finn and Jake. You guys look...cool. You trying out a new look?  Anyways, I'm preparing for a very important speech about the benefits of candying vegetables, and I need you guys to take care o-o-o-o-o-of  that.|Help Starchy set up chairs?
 No no no. That.|Oh boy. We're on it, princess.
 Other|Oh no.
 That's how you see him? That's beautiful.|Sure, I-I mean it's... It's hard not to sometimes. Where'd those glasses go?
 There.|Starchy! Give those back, you thief!
  Huh? No way! Starchy looks good!|Starchy, you butt!
  Ohh!|Oof, sorry.
 What's going on here?  Can you explain this?|I don't know. I'm not a psychiatrist!
 Okay, at least now we're safe from you donking up any more of our friends.|Nobody got hurt.
 Have any of you guys seen BMO?|Aah! Did I kill Neptr?!
 You turned him into a microwave. So...yeah, you kind of did.|But... but... but... That's not how I see Neptr, is it? I like Neptr. He's like my half-son. If I was a better person, would I be turning my friends into better things? Am I uncaring, judgmental...
 Uh, Finn.|Self-centered? Monstrous? I'm... I'm... I'm a huge wa-a-a-a-a-d! 
 Finn! You're being melodramatic!|I know it's you.
 Hey, buddy. I figured you'd come back here.|Don't look at me, Jake. I might turn you into a microwave.
" Baloney! You turned Neptr into a microwave because he's a microwave. But that doesn't mean that's all he is to you. I know you think Neptr is an interesting person, and I know that ""microwave"" is just one part of his personality. I mean...maybe your eyes are just bad at describing things, you know? Like how you feel about people, what they mean to you... That stuff's in your guts. Eyes can't grok that... Unless you have the eyes of like a trained artist or something. But you don't. I'm telling you, man"|Jake, you're so wise.
 Finn's just the best guy to do bro stuff with, like lying on the grass and talking to bugs or baking chocolate chip cookies. Finn's just a good friend.|I'm me again. These balls are going nuts.  Uh... My son.
 Ew.|Good job, Neptr. You saved the day.  Neptr! Neptr!
 |Eww! The sea lard’s in my bed again. Gross.
 Dude. That’s like the 8th time. Why don’t you just get rid of it?|I don’t know what’s gotten into it lately.
 It's gross as butts, man. We’re taking care of this right now.|I can’t believe we never thought of this before. The pond is the perfect place for a sea lard.
  Huh.|Is he, like, okay?
  Waaaa! |Sorry Shelby. Gotta save the lard.
  Thar!| Wa?
  ♫♪♪Smash the frogs, smash the frogs, making frog hot dogs, smash the frogs…..♫♪♪| Whoa!
 ♫♪♪Smash the frog -  Hi!|So, this is where you guys live?
  Hot dogs?!?!| Oh, wait. We dropped our sea lard in the pond, and we’ve got to save it before it dies from the freshwater. He’s a stenohaline fish.
 You do know sea lards are mammals, right?| Uhh.. I definitely knew that.  I’m gonna murder Shelby.
  And we gotta mash more frogs.|I can’t believe I just believe Shelby ‘cause he’s a nerd.
  I know. It's in his tone.  Dude, it's the lard!| Hey, get away from there!
  Hey, get away from there!| Bad lard! Lard!!
  Huh?  Don’t go near there! It’s too dangerous!| Got to save this dang lard!
  Whatever you do, don’t touch the purple stuff!| WHOOAH!
  What did she say? Don’t touch the purple?| What happened to the pond?
 And how ‘bout our treehouse? The house part’s a-gone! | What the butt?
 I guess we went through some portal to the past or some biz.| Was stuff the wrong color in the past?
  Was stuff the wrong color in the past?| It's weird as carbs here.
  The sea lard!  There it goes!| Lard!
  Hello, friends!| Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard!
 Lard, lard, lard, lard, lard|  ♫♪♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la laaaa!♫♪♪
 You are crazy. You are so crazy!| Everything’s like, wonky here. It’s familiar, but weird.
  I like it.|I don’t know. It kind of makes me feel… naked. ♫♪♪ La-la-la laaaard!♫♪♪
 I don’t know. It kind of makes me feel… naked. ♫♪♪ La-la-la laaaard!♫♪♪|Gotcha! Finally, we can take you home!
 ♫♪♪A one-and a-two- I’d rather be anything but me, a leaf on a tree, a bug or a bee. I just want to see the sea, I want to be free from this body, this flower body.♫♪♪| Please don’t change. You’re perfect just the way you are.
  Ohh! |Wait. Hey, Jake, what were we just doing?
  ♫♪♪Chasin’ the fish, Chasin’ the fish, and its getting away♫♪♪ |
  Bye!  You guys are writing this down, right?|Why does the lard keep running away? We're trying to get it home.
  Weren't we supposed to not do something with the purple things?| Hm?
  Heh! What a great gal.|Yeah.  Purple!  Wait- what were we just doing? We were.... We were.... Who are we?
 I don't know, man.  But I like these things.| Foon. I'm--- I'm Foon.  I'm..  Fine.
  Foon. I'm--- I'm Foon.  I'm..  Fine.|Huh? Ja-- Ja-- Jaaauump!
 Huh? Ja-- Ja-- Jaaauump!|Hello. Are you a lost dog? I am boy.
 Uh.. maybe?|We are boy and dog.
 I'm petting the ground, boy.|Looks like fun.
 Looks like fun.|And it smells like toast.
 And it smells like toast.|Huh? Crying. Long nose. 
  Investigate!| Miss, your crying indicates you're in need of help.
 What?  Yes. I've lost my rolling pin.|Understood. What's your name, miss?
  The hugs helped my crying, but it didn't help me find my rolling pin.|Boy and dog will find your rolling pin.  Where did you last see it?
 Come back, you bad little rolling pin!|Bush Boots, lets sneak up on it.
  Oh, its getting away again!|Ma'am, I think that rolling pin is sentient.
  Yeah, I don't think it wants to be a rolling pin.|Dog, we have to save that rolling pin from this sweet lady.  Where did it go?
 Dog, we have to save that rolling pin from this sweet lady.  Where did it go?| Rolling pin! We want to help!
  Rolling pin! We want to help!|No more.. Slime.
 Rolling pin trail has gone cold.|A bee. 
 A pink pond.|Pink pond? Pretty!
 The pond has a face and is talking to us.| Yeah.
  Dive in.|I don't feel comfortable diving into a face.
 I don't feel comfortable diving into a face.|Dog, lets go back for apricot pie.
 Gross!| Whoaaa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
 Other|But Simon, if you go there, you'll lose you memories.
 Other|Comfy, dude? I bet you ran away 'cause we didn't appreciate you and called you gross and stuff. But you're not gross.  Mwah! Goodnight, sea lard.
 Yeah, dude, but it's getting pretty late. We might got to catch him tomorrow.|Aww. What do you think, Finn Sword? Should we stay out a little longer?  Should we do a sword trick? Is that a better idea? 
 No looking.  I bet you can't do that behind your back.|Like this?  Sword trick! 
 What a sword trick.|Finn Sword, are you just loving this? 
 Oh, oh! I bet you can't do that and freestyle some bars.|I can do that! Hyup!  It's the boy I-I'm a boy Whoa! Aah!  Finn Sword! 
 You messed with me for years! Now it's my turn to mess with you! |Hey, Jake. You need help with demma Eggs Benedict inna demma hollandaise sauce?
  Get over here, dude.|Yo, no dogs on the table. Shoo! Get down, boy! Whatcha see, boy? Show daddy.
 I do see something, but you're making it weird.|Sorry bro. What's going on.
  Look.|Whoa. Hey, you! scram!
 Got him!| Uhh.. is he dead?
 Nah, he's magic.|Dude, he lost his powers, remember?
 Phew!|Come on. Let's bring him inside, you murderler.
 Finn and Jake! I need your help!|Why would we help you, Magic Man?
 It's Normal Man, and it's not helping me. It's helping my brother, Glob.|  Whaaaaaa?
 Maybe he'll listen to you and not hurt Glob. This could be my chance to make things right between us, go back to Mars and run things how we used to, before I threw everyone under the bus.|Like when you made them all go bald or something?
 What do you think about that?|No. Glob's your brother, and brothers always care about each other, even if one of them is a terrible deuce breakfast like you. So let's stretch up this thing and talk it out with Tiny.
 Who?|We get it. We got to stealth it up there.
 Oh, ouch, my knees.|Shh!
 Phew! Well, we got past those guys.|Easy greasy. You doing okay, Normal Man?
 I'm sorry, Jake! I'm just doing me right now. We're still cool, though?|Not no more!
 Whoa! Can I just have this?|Uh‐oh. Hang on like hot snot, Normal Man!
 And then I called you guys.|To find all the wire hangers?
  See anything?| No, it's pretty quite out there.
 Yeah, but not so much in here.|Huh? What does that mean?
 Huh? What does that mean?|Oh, Jake, no!
 Oh, Jake, no!|Wait, hold on.
 Other|What's going on? Is kidnapping hangers your new thing now?
 Other|Well... Yeah, because you're stealing all the hangers.
 Other|How long has this crack been here?
 Other|Let go of the hanger!
 Other|There's something in here.
 What is it?|I don't know.
  Dudes!|Hello.
 What year is this?|Uh, nobody really keeps time like that.
 It worked! I mean, I feel like it worked. This is the future, right?|Who are you? You're like a beautiful Ice King.
" Chill, you guys.  ""Chill""? Get it? I'm Patience St. Pim, the ICE ELEMENTAL! Whoo!  Did you see that? I made ice... with my hands."|I'm Finn the human, and this is Jake the dog.
 Other|He's been using his powers a lot today.
 Yeah. Uh, hey, this might be a weird question, but do you know where the slime, candy, and fire dudes are?|She's talking about the princesses.
 Other|Hold on a minute. You can't make Simon start kidnapping princesses again.
 Excuse me for a second, boyfriend.|Okay Jake---
 What's plan C, again? Something about music?| Poor Finn Sword. I'm sorry, man. What the heck is that? It's gonna distract me from my sword staring. Better track down the source and kill it.
 We are going live in five!|What is this? A concert?
 And guess who the special celebrity guest judge is?|Donny?
 Human. Come home to safety.|Hey, Jake, what about this one?
 Neutralizing. Please do not turn your system off during neutralization.|Holy mud! It took out the Gumball Guards like they was nothin’!
 We gotta chop this thing into smashaghetti.|I’ll take you out with these hug nubs!
 Hostile mutant neutralized.| You got this, Finn Mertens. You’re a buff little bionic baby.  Rush! Rush!
  You got this, Finn Mertens. You’re a buff little bionic baby.  Rush! Rush!|Rush!
 PG-8-7.|Uh… You mean me?
 PG-8-7 Mertens, please climb aboard. Please climb aboard. Come on.|Mertens? Wait, do you, like, know me?
 You okay, dude?|I feel like that ship might’ve been important, but I’m fine.
 BMO!|BMO, you okay?
 Hi, Finn.|Uh, sorry again my grass arm busted you up.
 It’s okay. At the time, Susan was gonna bust you up. Where’s Jake? Is he okay?|He’s outside. He’s bringing the ship over.
 I don’t know, Susan. It’s so far. Even I don’t know what’s out there. It’s a pretty risky solo mission.|I’m going too. I mean, we gotta find out where this ship came from. There could be more of them. And, if this is human-made, then there might be other humans on that island. That’d be cool to see, right?
 ...Oh, I lost focus. Hey, yeah, can we borrow your boat?|Are you up here, Fern?
 It’s nice up here.|Stay as long as you want. I came up here to ask a favor. I might be gone for a while on this trip, see, and I need someone to, uh, cover for me here in Ooo.
 Are you sure? I mean, hero biz is your whole thing. And, whatever I am, I’m not you.|You can just do your own thing with it. Like, if some huge gross monster’s gonna do murder on a buncha innocents, uh, kill it! But kill it you-styles. Just don’t go nuts.
 Thanks for trusting me.|No, thank you, Fern. I better go pack.
 Uh… We should figure out a better thing.|Let’s figure out something better.
 Finn, did you bring your nail clippers?|Uh, I think so.
 Cool, I forgot too.|Bye, treehouse!
 Ouch.|Thanks for seeing us off, guys.
 I want you to be really careful out there.|Don’t worry. We’ve got Susan.
 That’s not what I mean. Finn, I get the sense that this trip’s more important to you than you’re letting on. I mean, if you make it to that island, you might find out some pretty heavy stuff. About the humans and where you came from. About yourself. All I’m saying is, you have to promise me, promise me, that you’ll come home safe.|I-
 I have a lot of fuzzy half-memories from when I was this guy.|Well, just keep the ones where she’s our boss, and forget everything else.
 Ah! I flinched.|It’s cool.
 It’s cool.|We’ll be back soon, I promise!
 Heck yeah! We’re home.|That was definitely the longest adventure we’ve ever done.
 What about when you got trapped in a mind dungeon for a buncha years?|This trip was longer in emotional time.
 Let’s go take hot showers!|Hey, look at this fish.
 Hey, look at this fish.|It’s… gummy?
 Hello!|Hey!
 Hey!|Well, that’s weird. We should defs check it out after we hit up the tree house.
 Yeah. We gotta get to the bottom of this hot shower.|Hmm. Does everything seem pinker to you?
 What the heck happened to the tree house?|Candy… Fern?
 Candy… Fern?|Oh, I do not like this.
 Is this some kind of sick joke? Because I love it.|Huh? Big Baby Root Beer? No one buys this brand. It’s too sweet.
 Hello?|Ah!
 Hey! You look like me.|Fern?
 Welcome, strangers! It’s so cool that you’re inside our house.|Dude, when did you guys turn into candy?
 Neptr is so cute now! I’m going to start treating him as an equal.|You were supposed to take care of Ooo while I was gone. What happened with that?
 What?|You used to be this volatile plant boy, remember?
 Wow, gummy Shelby’s a lot of fun. I think I’m okay with candy world.|No way. Let’s talk to P.B. I’m sure this is all one of her experiments gone wrong.
 You seem upset, friend. The tower will fix you right up.|The what, now?
 Hey, I want some of that!|No. That is body juice.
 Hmm? What’s that? Did you spurn my fluids?|No…?
 Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower!|Come on, Jake. Let’s go see Bubblegum.
 Stop striding! It just keeps you agitated.|I’m freaking out, Jake. This place is weird.
 What I’m hearing is, you’re stressed out because everything’s candy.|Aren’t you?
 And Fern is, like, laughing and joking around. Maybe they don’t need you to fix them.|Hmm.
 Hmm.|I always believe you when you use that voice.
 I always believe you when you use that voice.|Sweet P.?
 Sweet P.?|Hey, buddy. What are you doing out-
 Hey, buddy. What are you doing out-|-Hey! You’re meat!
 Yes, I’m meat. But everything else is weird.|Wow, Sweet P., that’s almost exactly what I’ve been saying.
 They look so happy, like dogs.|Don’t worry, Sweet P. We’re headed to the candy kingdom to see Princess Bubblegum about all this.
 She’s not in the candy kingdom. She’s in the terrible tower. Look!|Come on, Jake, that’s kind of weird, right?
 Sweet P., come back!|Uh… Let’s get to the tower.
 And never be the guy with no phone, Finn. You’ll think it’ll make people wanna talk to you more, but people just forget to invite you to things.|You’ve convinced me. Plus, I like late night bedtime calls when you’re sleeping over at Lady’s.
 S’more!|Stay back, s’more!
 Yay! I love Marshmaline songs!|No time for tunes. Do you know where Bonnie is?
 Yahoo!|What… What happened to you?
 ‘Scuse me.|What about Tree Trunks, and Lemongrab, and Marceline, and everyone else?
 I fixed ‘em, obviously.|“Fixed ‘em?” But they’re your friends!
 That means it’s fine.|No. It’s not fine!
 Don’t fret. I can fix you too.|I can feel my bones turning gummy!
 I’m connected to all candy throughout all the galaxies. Once you’re candy, you’ll be part of me too!|No! That plan sucks.
 No! That plan sucks.|Oh, my gosh!
 Oh, my gosh!|Ah! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!
 Ah! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!|I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!
 Other|Ice King?
 Ice King?|Hold on to me, bro!
 No!|Wait, we forgot BMO!
 They have nowhere else to go.|Are we in…
 Cloud Kingdom.|Looks like we got away before the candy curse became permanent.
 Other|Thanks for getting us out of there, Simon.
 Other|Hey, why are you even up here?
 Finn...You gotta see this.|Oh...my...
 Oh...my...|...butt.
 Thanks.|So, how is your toast?
 Pretty good. Funny, though, I can kind of taste the toast's emotions or something. Getting ground into flour and then made into bread really did a number on this wheat's sense of self.|That's a pretty hyper‐developed sense of taste you've got there. Hey, you seem kind of different.
 Nope. Same old Jake.|You're blue, you've got those five eyes, you're way bigger, and you keep discovering strange new abilities. I think this might be a situation.
 Ahhh! Jake is a crab! Ahhh! |Same old Jake. If you say so.
 Finn, you up?|Yeah, man.
 I had a really bad dream last night. So ominous. These images are going to haunt me for, like, forever.|Sometimes it helps me if I draw a bad dream in picture form. My crayons!
 It was a weird scene, all right. Chanting ladies, labyrinths, classical sculpture. And Jermaine was there, too. The weird thing was that he was painting abstract art.|So? F.Y.I., Jermaine hates abstract art. He would never paint something non‐representational.
 So? F.Y.I., Jermaine hates abstract art. He would never paint something non‐representational.|Maybe he's just trying something new?
 It's not in his nature. Why would he all of a sudden get into painting meaningless shapes?|He's probably fine.
 Just feels so out of character, you know, for Jermaine.|How's the drawing?
 Just squiggles.| Fuelish tank! You are too slow for the Finnosaurus. Give up! Give up!
  I knew I had seen that mountain.| Tank boys,you have no hope. 
 Yeah, I went to see Jermaine. He says hi.|No, I mean, like,you're really back.
 An angry -- no, shy shark baby.|What if life was always just constant fun times on the river?
 Yes, let's never do anything boring ever ag--  Time for Ice King's boring book reading.|Aw, come on! He's just gonna read those weird stories that are basically about us.
 Needs more hunks!|Dude, I literally have one bazillion questions.  Uh, excuse me, Miss Fionna... Where did this video come fr-o-o-m!
 Photosynthesize! Photosynthesize! Photo-|You grabbing a snack, Fern?
 Yeah. Water and light combine so I can make my own food. In case I don't catch anything.|Come on, man, don't be so dow-  Hey, I got something!
 Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!|Pretty weird fish, huh?
 That's me - the dude who dinks it up, just like I dinked it up when you left Ooo. I was supposed to protect it. Instead, it went all crazy. I didn't even help. I just covered myself in root beer and danced around like a dummy. I can't do anything right!|Hey, stop it. You need a squoze?
 I feel better.|Sometimes being a good dude ain't about not dinking it. Learn from your dinks. Like, you know my first battle with a giant? I never told anybody this, but-
 You boom-boomed in your shorts. I know. I have your memories.|Yeah, I boom-boomed. The point is I learned from it, and now I'm Finn. You got to learn how to be Fern.
  What's that sound?|Oh, I bet it's a monster. Let's fight this dude Fern's way.
  Sweet P?  Whoa!|Okay, Fern, what do you think we should do next?
 Mm, sever his tendons? |
 Before you say no, it would stop him from running.|We're gonna handle this librarian style.  Shh. Librarian.  Kiss. You can renew the book and bring it back next week.
 Mm.|Great thinking, Fern.
 I just copied you. Is that thinking?| What up, buttercup? Why you run, pork bun?
 The monster!|Was it LSP?
 And I've been running and running since then.|Aww, Sweet P. It sounds like you might just be having bad dreams.
 No, I only have one dream anymore.|Uhh...
" But the whisper monster is even scarier, saying stuff like, ""Sweet P, you're bad. You always have been bad."" I don't want to be bad. "|Oh, you're not bad. You're super good. Now, let's get you home.
 |Fern!
 Fern!|Okay, okay, we'll see you in the morning, Tree Trunks.  All right, bedtime, Sweet P.
 You want me to knock him out?|Er, not this time. How about a bedtime story?
 Yes, please.|Once there was a kingdom of spaghetti.
 Mmm.| Punch, punch. Kiss, kiss.
 Listen to your bones.| Fern.
  Fern.| Fern!
 Hey. What's up?| I heard something. Can you see what it is with your tree senses?
 Uh, can I help you?|Oh, sorry. We heard you scuttling around and thought-
" What? You didn't hear me ""scuttling around."" Foxes are silent hunters. I mean, geez, do you know how rude that is? Ugh. Gonna be brooding about this all week."|Sorry, man.
 Look.|Aah! Get off him!
 I got him!|Oh, no. I know where I've seen that thing before.
 You will not believe what just happened.|It must've been the day that BMO found that little sailor hat. Hold him down, Fern! That hand is the flippin' Lich!
  Yes, child. I have returned once more to-|Bah! Bah! Bah! Bah! Evil! You're gonna get it for messing with our boy Sweet P.
 That vessel may appear harmless, but he came from me. Once I remind him of his legacy, The Lich shall reign once more. Isn't that right, son?|Aah!
" Why did Mr. Hand call me ""son""? Was that my monster daddy?"|Okay, delegate, delegate - Fern, stay here and guard Sweet P. I'm gonna try and catch up.
 Don't trust me to guard anything. I'm a total scrub-up.| Dude, there's already one Lich loose in Ooo. If Sweet P turns E-V-I-L tonight, there might be a second. I need you here.  You got this!
  I can't come to the phone right now. I'm either hanging with Finn, my kids, my GF, or I'm dead. Bye! |Hey man, hit me when you get this.  Dude's missing a Lich fight.  Okay, Lich. Get ready to die. Again. For, like, the fifth time!
 Hey man, hit me when you get this.  Dude's missing a Lich fight.  Okay, Lich. Get ready to die. Again. For, like, the fifth time!|Oh, hey, it's this awful place.
 Oh, hey, it's this awful place.|Oh, you're tricky, huh?
 Oh, you're tricky, huh?|I can hear you down there! Speak up, man. What?
  You've bested me in many worlds, child, but I always return.|You're so evil it's boring. You're basic, man.
 I, too, am doom.|Hey, what's going on up there?
  Child, you have failed. The vessel has turned. We reign now as twin kings of ruin.|Sweet P...
 Beast, obey me! Obey- No!|Eesh.
 Hooray!|You're a natural! But where's Fern?
 He wouldn't let me follow you, so I knocked him out cold.|Yeah, I met my bio-dad once too. He wasn't evil incarnate, but he was kind of a crummy dude. TT and Mr. P love you. That's all that matters. Fern! Sweet P saved me and slew The Lich!
  It doesn't matter how hard I try. I'll always just be in the shadow of the real Finn. Unless I could become...  the only Finn.|Uh, yeah, but that's a weird thing to call me.
 Ha, nah, man.  Imitating uncool people infects you with their loserishness.|Oh. Yeah, that rings true.  It's too bad you didn't develop any coop-poop-scooping skills. That coop is incredibly disgusting.
 Actually, about that, I was thinking that, instead, maybe you and I could explore some secret ruins I found.|Secret ruins?! Sweet! Maybe we can still catch up with Jake and BMO! Or maybe Neptr could come! Hey, Neptr, you want to go on an adventure, buddy?!
 Actually, I was thinking maybe just you and me would go. Spend some quality time together, Finn and Fern style.|Yeah, okay. That actually even sounds like something Jake would want us to do.  Forget it, Neptr!  ♪ Dungeon surprise, right before my eyes, what a surprise, the dungeon surprise. ♪
  One, two, three - shoot! Rock! One, two, three - shoot! Scissors!| This is so weird. I can't tell if it's boring or fun.
 Well, I can. It's boring. I want the thrill of victory! Who wants to be the same all the time?|Come on, man! You know you love it! Come on! One, two, three... Come on!
 Rock.|Paper.
 What?!|Whoa! I won this time.
 What? But that's not fair!  Why is nothing ever fair?|Hey, Fern, it's just a game. Don't be so weird.
 Don't-! ...Don't call me that.| Sorry.
 Ah, it's okay. That stuff won't mean a thing. I mean, that stuff don't mean a thing. Hey, come on, we're almost there!  Whoop, whoop, whoop!|Hey, wait up!  Whoop, whoop!
  Look, we're here!|Where? I just see a bunch of rock, swear to glob.
 But check this out. |Whoa! Magic key!
 I had to chop up a bunch of stubborn so-and-sos to get my hands on this baby. |Dang. You've been busy.
 Dang. You've been busy.|Wow, would you look at that! They hid this ziggurat in the cliff side. Amazing!
 Yeah, I poked around in there a bit, but-|Dut, dut, dut! No spoilers!
 No, I know. I didn't go past the first level. I was saving it to do together.|Sweet.  Whoa, what is that, a fitness pole?  Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya!
 Come on.  This way. |Hey, Fern, wait up. Hey, I just want to say that it's really cool that you're into this stuff. You know - that we have so much in common. It feels almost like we're real brothers, right? Or even closer.
  I think that's the treasure chamber down there. Why don't you go check it out? I want to study these interesting carvings.  Hmm. Fascinating.|Oh. Uh, okay. I guess just holler if you need me.  Hey, what's this?  Contemporary chair, contemporary trash, contemporary meatloaf? Hey, bad news, Fern. It looks like we've got a squatter situation here.
 Oh. Uh, okay. I guess just holler if you need me.  Hey, what's this?  Contemporary chair, contemporary trash, contemporary meatloaf? Hey, bad news, Fern. It looks like we've got a squatter situation here.|I think they got the treasure, but they left some meatloaf behind. The good news is I know a meatloaf dealer-
 I think they got the treasure, but they left some meatloaf behind. The good news is I know a meatloaf dealer-|"What the? Fern?  Fern?  Uh, Fern? I think maybe the wind blew the door shut. An ""act of nature"", I would presume."
 I'm sorry. I don't actually know how to make meatloaf. That's just a pan of dirt.|Well, that's okay. I don't know how to either! ...Fern, please open the door.
 This is where you live now. You'll be fine.|What?! Fern, what about Jake and BMO - my home?
 It's been your home long enough. It's Fern's turn. I think I'm going to be a really great Finn. Hey, do you know who my favorite is? It's Neptr. I'm a Neptr guy! I'll be back in a month with a new bucket of trash. Later! |Fern!?  I've been double-crossed by grass Finn! I don't like being abandoned! I'm sensitive to it!  Mmm!  It's too hot!  There's got to be something useful in here.
 Fern!?  I've been double-crossed by grass Finn! I don't like being abandoned! I'm sensitive to it!  Mmm!  It's too hot!  There's got to be something useful in here.|You'll be back in a month?! With a new bucket of trash?! It's hot! There's no air in here! I need air! I need air!
 You'll be back in a month?! With a new bucket of trash?! It's hot! There's no air in here! I need air! I need air!|Wha?  Oh! A microphone. There's some dried ketchup on it.  Uh, hello.
 Hi, Finn! You're still asleep after your fight with Susan. But when you wake up, I'm sure you'll have fun discovering everything your new arm can do. And Finn, sincerely, thank you for defending our kingdom again. Oh. Someone else wants to thank you, too.  Thank you, Finn!  I don't know. Okay, um... Welcome, Finn!|Huh.
 Huh.|Yes!
 Huh?|You donked up! 
 Hey!|What do you think you're doing?!
 You've been Finn long enough! It's my turn. |Fern, smarten up!
  Nuh-uh!| What are you?
 A weed whacker.|My belzer!
 |Fern, if things are going down the way I think they're going down, please tell Jake I love him.
 That doesn't matter. I love him!|I know you do, Fern. Listen, we can stop this and just go home together. All this lying and fighting, it doesn't have to end like this. Today doesn't have to have this kind of... finality.
 Feeling good, buddy?|I'm good. But this chump's about to get slain!
  Slay him quick. He's got crazy devil strength!|No prob. Here comes the slay...
 Don't kill me, Finn.|Um... Here I go!  Mathematical!
 I'm your friend. I'm you.|Jake, maybe you should slay this guy?
 Thanks again for coming out to coach. The jamboree's always a big morale boost for the troops.|Yeah. It's, uh, a nice distraction.
 Hmm. So how are you holding up after all the Fern stuff?|It's been a rough month, PB. I know Fern was an angry guy who tried to kill me, but I still feel awful about the way he went. It's really messing with me.
 A banana and fudge monster?! That's candy tech. Okay, who's behind this?  Finn! I need you and Jake to guard the barracks tonight. If this creep comes back and lays a finger on my guards, you show no mercy.|Um... Yeah, I'll... do my best.
 Finn! Finn, stop showing mercy!|Oh, no! I dinked it!
 Oh, no! I dinked it!|Jake, I'm sorry! I- I couldn't do it!
  Love you forever, man, but your guilt's hurting the team dynamics.|I know. I'm gonna go make it right! 
 Cool. I'm gonna make peace with my aging body.|No mercy this time, banana boy! I don't care why you're doing this or if you have a... a tragic past.  I don't care! I'm hard like that.
 Don't kill me, Finn.| Nope!
  Nope!|Oh, gross!
 Oh, gross!|What the heck is my problem?!
 What the heck is my problem?!|Aw, fudge!
 Aw, fudge!|Huh?! How'd I do that?!
 Um, it's getting away.|Aah! Oh, Huntress Wizard!
 Hey, Finn.  Come on! After that booger!|Thanks for the save, HW.
 Mm-hmm.|You're chasing that grabby banana too, huh?
 I'm hunting it. It's an invasive species that's been destroying the local ecosystem with its nasty hot fudge. It's name is the Grumbo. It's a name that I made up just now... because you can't hunt what you can't name.|Yeah, makes sense.
 Hmm.| So how you been?
 Finn, I saw you falter back there. Why did you hesitate before you dealt the final blow?| It keeps happening since I aced Fern. Every time I'm about to wail on some monster, I remember seeing Fern go kaboom... and the guilt paralyzes me. I can't seem to final blow anybody.
 I see. Okay, let's vanquish your mental block. Because I'll need your help to defeat the Grumbo. It's a two-huntress job.|The second huntress is me.
 The trail goes gold here. I mean, the fudge is still hot, but that squirrel dude just ate most of it.| What? No! Ugh, I should have struck when I had the chance! Or not struck Fern when I didn't have the chance? Ugh! I don't even know anymore.
 Looks like we got some hot fudge on our hands. Okay, let's review our roles. When I take out its legs, you strike the underbelly. Got it?|I can do this. I'm 90% sure I can do this. Gonna slice right through that sweet Fern face.
 Ready?| Yes.
 Duck - I guess.|Huh?
 Now, Finn! Coop-degrassi!|Okay, time to final blow it!
 Finn, don't you love me?| Uh, can we maybe switch roles?
  Not again.|Oops! Oops. Oops. Oops!
 Oops! Oops. Oops. Oops!| HW, let's come back and try tomorrow!
  Okay...|Huntress Wizard, get out of the way!
 Huntress Wizard, get out of the way!|Think, think, think!  Okay, if I can't fix my mind, I gotta fool it.  Attack. Attack. Attack.
 Finn, help me.|I'll save you, buddy.
 I'll save you, buddy.|I did it. Sorry I almost got you killed.
 It's cool. It's totally cool. I knew you just needed a push. That's why I very smartly pretended to throw myself in harm's way. |No, actually, that's not what did it.
 I don't have my peel! Don't look, don't look anyone! |It's okay, guys. Huntress Wizard is into natchy living.
 Weird. These Grumbo remains are 100% artificial candy flesh - like straight out of a lab.|I wonder who made him.
 |Huh?
 I was just sipping my coffee.|Oh. 
 |
 |
 Today is the first day of my new job.|What's your new job, BMO?
 Well, gentlemen... got to chop that wood.| It's Ice King.
 Poor little guy. Still wearing out the shoe leather trying to make just one more lousy sale before coming home.|He'll feel better after we have a little party for him.
 Hello, boys. Meet the salesman of the year. Or maybe of the decade. The Chinese food is on me. I mean, check out the loot. | It's real.
 Just a line of smooth talk and pipe dreams. Oh, and a set of human baby teeth.|Where did you even get a set of human baby teeth?  Human baby teeth!!  BMO!
 Oh, sure, I sold your baby teeth. I could sell any part of you.|These were, like, the only things I had left from when I was a little kid.
 Well...| Stay back, baby Finns. 
 |They're made out of some kind of hard tooth-like material. Ouch. Ouch! Ice King, freeze these nightmare babies.
 Yeah. Where did I put those - Oh, here they are.  Gentlemen, could I interest you in a couple of sledgehammers? Perfect for smashing through minerals or composites.| I'll take one.
 Other|Yeah, you're not doing this tomorrow.

  Okay! I'll get this paperwork processed, and we'll be in business. |Toronto!
  What?!|Aw, don't worry. Look at this mug. You could out-rap him any day of the week.
  Son of Rap Bear?|I wonder if he's any relation to Rap Bear.
 Rap Bear lives in there?|It's surprisingly nice.
 It's surprisingly nice.|Knock knock.
  Who's there?| Rap Bear. What happened?
  My son and I were having Sunday dinner. We were lightly rapping back and forth. It turned into a rap battle. He threw out rhyme after rhyme. I couldn't keep up.|You got beat by your own son? Are his rap powers that much greater than yours?
 Yes. Why are you asking about my son?|Flame Princess is going up against him one on one in a freestyle battle.
  That kid will take you apart.  He rapped my legs off.|Rap Bear, Son of Rap Bear's father, said his son, Son of Rap Bear, would be at tonight's open mic.
 Son of Rap Bear is right. I just rap about rapping. I haven't traveled the world or done anything really. Finn! Let's go on some adventures!|What?

  Thanks, Finn. Hey where'd you get this goblet?| Oh, uh, I think we won it in a fight with an octopus we were fighting in, like, a sea cave full of treasure?
  It reminds me of a cup my uncle used to have.| You mean your Uncle Gumbald, right?
  Hurrah!| Whoa, for real?
  Enjoying your party?| It's great having fun with all my friends. Well, some of my friends mostly Banana Guards.
  Yeah, sorry about that. The Candy Kingdom is in full lockdown until I can sort out the rumors about my Uncle Gumbald. He's been gone for years, but we should stay vigilant.| Don't worry, PB. Now that I'm 17, I'm feelin' ready for anything. Feels like I'm really hitting my stride, y'know?
  Finn, I want to give you your gift before I forget. It's a harmonica.| Awesome! 
  Finn, I designed an exciting new game for you.| Show me.
"  It's called ""Birthday Boyfighter. "| Looks like another hit.
  I got you a present too. It has emotional and metaphorical significance.| It's beautifully wrapped. Wonder what it is.
  It's an elk's heart.| Oh, cool. I don't have one of those.
  Oh, cool. I don't have one of those.| What's that sound?
  Zombie cows.| You're green!
  I'm the Green Knight! And before you ask, yes, of course, I brought you a birthday present. It's a battle axe.| That's some axe. Am I an axe guy though? I've always thought of myself as a sword guy.
  But only if you play me a game for it.| What's the game?
"  Oh, this game is called ""All you have to do is strike me with it, and it is yours."""| Mm?  I can't axe some stranger. Wait a minute! Where's Jake? I know what's going on.
  No, I don't think you do.| Relax, Princess. Jake loves playing birthday pranks on me.
  Yes, of course One of Jake's classic pranks.| Okay, I'm in.
  May your aim be steady.|  Sure thing Jake!  I win!
  Happy birthday, Finn.|  Jake! When did you Whose head did I Are you pranking me?
  My guards!| I got this. Raah!  Eel!
  He's playing Mr. Laughing Silent Guy.| Game's over, bro.
  The game isn't over until I strike you.| Hmm. Let's come up with a better way to settle this, like reasonable late teens.
  I'm listening.| Well, we've got everything set up for party games. How about if I beat you two out of three, you got to answer our questions.
  And if I win chop, chop.| Deal.
  Wait, Finn, I think he's plotting something.| I-It's fine. I'm 17. I'm hittin' my stride.
  I-It's fine. I'm 17. I'm hittin' my stride.| Hey, Green Knight, why are they all mimey?
  | Okay, guy. Why don't we start with something basic like balls and coconuts. Hup! Hup! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. Ba-ba-ba-boom! Boom!
   Okay, Finn! Yeah, yeah! You got it, Finn! You go, boy!|  Boooooooom!   Aw, what? I'll let you have that one, 'cause I'm a big boy today. But let's see you try and beat four out of five, huh?
  How do you like them coconuts?|  I hate them coconuts.
  It was. I saw it all with my Huntress vision. Finn is totally getting played.|  All right. You got a freaky curveball, man. But can you climb a greasy pole?
  A greasy pole?! It's hard enough climbing a non-greasy pole!| Ready?
   Mm-hmm!| One, two, three, go!  Ha, ha! 
  One, two, three, go!  Ha, ha! | Huh?
  He's got this. He's 17.| Who's the ma-a-an? Who's the 17-year-old ma-a-a-an?  Hoo! You've been a good sport, so I'll let you choose the tiebreaker.
  Very well. Hmm How about a game of some good old-fashioned arm wrestling?| Arm wrestling, huh? I see what you did there. My guns are obviously weak as heck from climbing that greasy pole. If only I had some kind of  superhuman robot arm. Bam!
  Three, two, one, go!|  Ahh!
  You can't tell from my face, but I am smiling triumphantly.| Nooo! It's my birthday!
  I know. It's my birthday, too.| Fern?
  Fern! We've seen enough.| 
  The vampire girl is legitimately scary. Very well. You've witnessed our superior technology and watched your champion crushed.| 
  | This is my worst B-day ever.
 I wonder what it could be.|Maybe it's a gross rotting fish gob with long, slimy tentacles.
 Maybe it's a teenage silverware werewolf squatter.|Hey, you know what it could be? It could be a ghost. I think I saw a ghost there when I was a baby. Maybe it's like a ghost hotspot.
  Ghost Mom and Dad!|I have to brush my hair!
 Man, I've never been this excited about ghosts before.|This could be one more chance to tell Mom and Dad how much we love them.
 Hello? Ghosts? If you're in here, please vacate my son's property!|Unless you're Mom and Dad ghosts!
 Yeah, in that case, I brought flowers!|Look. There's the broken window. But I don't see any signs of squatters... or ghosts.
  I'll sniff 'em out. |Hey Jake, why don't we own this place?
 I dunno. Kim Kil Whan is a good businessman. Plus I'd feel kinda weird dealing with this stuff.|"Yeah. Just looking at all this is like, ""Whoa, memories!"" Like this ticker tape machine. Remember when Mom and Dad brought us to work and we made a fort of ticker tape?"
 It was right over there! And over here you gave me a wet willie one time.|Ew. No I didn't.
 Right. I know you believe that's true, but memories distort over time. Classic false memory syndrome.|Maybe you're the one with a false memory syndrome.
 Classic false memory syndrome response.|You hear that? Can you use your dog powers to locate that sound?
  Way ahead of you, pal. Uh... over there!  Aha! |Anything?
 Nope. This is a nice bathroom, though. Man, this whole office is nice. It's kinda bunk how Mom and Dad stopped using it.|Yeah, it's weird that they had this whole other life, and they just dropped it for us babies.
 We were babies forever.|Man, we suck.
  Yeah, but they knew what they were getting into. Whoa! Who moved the sofa? Who put forth those chairs?! Who set the table?! What's going on?!|This griz is poltergeist biz.
 But I don't want that.|Embrace the paranormal, bro.  Are these candles real or poltergeist mind-tricks?
 Margaret! Margaret! There's another one over here!|Dude! This place is full of ghosts! We should split up and see if we can get them to appear.
 I'll take the bathroom!|"That's the spirit. Hmm. ""Spirit."""
" That's the spirit. Hmm. ""Spirit."""|Maybe Mom and Dad left some books about ghost hunting. Hmm. 
 Maybe Mom and Dad left some books about ghost hunting. Hmm. | A ghost!  It seems like the ticking precedes each ghost encounter. Okay, Finn, what ticks? Metronomes, bombs, pencils...
 The bathroom is a lot scarier than I was expecting.|...hearts, egg timers, typewriters.
 ...hearts, egg timers, typewriters.|What else?  Whoa, lil' ghost babies! Wait, that's baby Jermaine! And baby Jake! And baby me!
 Babababa!| Oh yeah?
 Oh! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!| Oh, snap. I guess it was me. Hold on. These babies ain't ghoulish ghosts at all. They're like time... disto...to...morphs? Hmm.
 Dad?|So, I can see you, and you can see me. And we're occupying the same space now. So this time stuff must be getting more intense.  Whoa!
   |  Aw, dude! You couldn't wait until you were back in your own time?
   Aw, dude! You couldn't wait until you were back in your own time?|Hey, creeper, stop creepin' on baby Jake!  Baby Jake?
 That's so not how I was birthed! I'm no melon baby! I'm a majestic womb baby!|Jake, calm down.
 We're trapped in a ghost trap!|Relax, bro. There's no ghosts. What we're experiencing are time slips. Point is, something is causing this.
 Relax, bro. There's no ghosts. What we're experiencing are time slips. Point is, something is causing this.|You ready?
 You ready?|Time dingalings! Wait, that ticking. I know who this is!  Clock Bear!
 One of the dudes that escaped Dr. Gross' menagerie.|He must be the one causing the time slips. There's us from before. 
 |Are you sick?
 Yeah, I'm pretty disgusted with the whole situation!|I meant Clock Bear.
 I meant Clock Bear.| He's sucking up all the spilled time!
 That doesn't sound scientific!| Jake, take care of Clock Bear. There's something I gotta do!
 We're doin' what now?|It was just Clock Bear... No, I don't think he has any money.  Jake? Jake!  Oh, no! Something's happened to Jake! He could be in grave dang-  ...Okay, then.
 What you doing, Finn?|Jake left me this note, but I, uh  I can't remem what the abbreve means.
  It's for me! This is Jake's special code to tell me he loves me.|No, it's something normal like, uh...
 Be right back. |"Right! ""Be right back!""  So dumb. Cool. Jake'll be right back."
 Look, Finn! My Jake Valentines. He leaves them for me when he goes out.|That's cute, BMO.
 Yeah, I know.|Oh, Ble. I love Ble!  I'll read some Ble 'til Jake gets back, I guess.
 Oh, Ble. I love Ble!  I'll read some Ble 'til Jake gets back, I guess.|" ""What's your favorite food?"" ""Anything! As long as it's made of cheese!""

 Was the tiger already biting his foot? Or did the tiger bite his foot after he lay down on the couch? Because that is the bearded man's responsibility.|BMO, I love you, but you don't understand comedy.
 Maybe it's just not funny.| This is funny, and I'm gonna prove it!
 You are?|Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty bored, and this is really funny, BMO.
  Prove it!| Fine! I'm going to!
 Fine!  I'll be right here!|Fine!
 Intruder! Intruder! It's our friend, Finn!|What's all the hubbub, Bubs?
 Oh, just some precautionary exercises in case our primary alarm and defense system fails.|Cool. Cool. Hey, can you look at this funny thing I wrote?
 Oh, sure! I'm fascinated by humor.  Hmm! Yes. Certainly what this hirsute gentleman needs is a tetanus shot. Excellent point, Finn.|No, but... is it funny? Never mind.
" Der Witz Und Seine Beziehung Zum Unterbewussten. ""The Joke and his Relation to the Unconscious"". It's printed in Gebrochene Schrift, which I think is easier on the eyes."|"""Der Witz Und...

 Other|Heh. Yeah. That's pretty good, I guess.
 Other|"Right?! And ""Animal Quackers""!"
 Other|And if I get my winning caption printed, everybody will know it's funny! I'm talking about you, BMO. But, uh, where do they print Ble?
 You go, girl!|Whoa. Why don't you just use that thing all the time?
 Other|It must be so fun to work here, just sittin' around, making up jokes all day.
 Hey! Hey.|Aww. Who are you?
 I'm a pudding troll, and I guard this humor magazine.|Uhhhh, why?
 It's... my job.|Why is this your job?
 I... applied? I'm maybe not following you. I think I better escort you off the premises.|No! No, no, no. We just want to pitch a cartoon caption!
  Hey, Big Tina, it's your time to shine, okay?|Waahh!
 Waahh!|Okay, what's our plan here?
 Other|Wait. You can fly!
 Other|Well, shoot, man. Looks like everyone here is crazy dead.
 I've been guarding dead people for five hundred years. Wow, I need to sit with that.|This means that Ble Magazine is dead, too!  Now how am I supposed to prove my caption's funny.
 Other|" ""I'm going to write you a prescription for one giant club."" "
 Other|Our very own Ble Magazine.
 Other|Wow. It looks amazing in print.
 Guys, I'm gonna be honest, just speaking as an average Josephine, I really don't get that caption.|Maybe it doesn't matter if my caption is funny or not. I think I just wanted to be part of Ble. It's something I've been a fan of for so long. And maybe we can bring it back. There's no reason it can't have a new dawn. A Blennaissance!
 Other| No, you're right. Can't be nostalgic!
  No, you're right. Can't be nostalgic!|Man, that caption was amazing in my head. Maybe I'm not a very funny person. Like, I got low comedy stats. That's kind of a bummer.
 Man, that caption was amazing in my head. Maybe I'm not a very funny person. Like, I got low comedy stats. That's kind of a bummer.|Yo, BMO. Check it out! I got Ble to publish my caption, even though I don't need you to think I'm funny anymo-
 Whoa!| Jake?
  Boiled eggs. In the fridge.|Jake! You're back! I've missed you so mu- Oh.
 Uh, hi Finn. It's just me.|Jermaine! You and Jake both have sort of a grapefruit nature to you.
 I came to your playhouse because I'm worried about Jake.|Don't worry, he's fine. He left a note.
 How long ago did he leave that?|Uh, I dunno. Maybe five weeks?
  Whoo. Finn, you know you can call me if you're in trouble, right? Our brother's missing, and I come here finding you doing a lazy man's load with a hundred boiled eggs.|It's all they have at the store.
 I think he's all alone in outer space. I don't think he can come home, and he's running out of birthday cake and cocktail hot dogs.|Jake's in space?!
  I know! It's chilling.|Hmm. Oh! So, this cosmic stuff, planets and space...  This is Normal Man-type subjects.  We're going to Mars!
 Into the basement. Sure is lots of broken glass and decay down here. I'll be honest - I was just talking a lot because I'm nervous.| I know.
  I know.| Jake.
  Mars.|Dang. Looking real prosperous around here.
 Who's the statues, do you think?|Maybe Margles? But I've only seen a photo of her. Wait! Betty?
 Oh, Finn. Uh, how is-|I haven't seen you, Betty, since you double-crossed everyone.
 I-|Ya slopped up!
 Finn! Empathy! |Normal Man.
 Nay! King Man!  Finn, Betty is tormented. Just look at her.|Oh.
  G-G-G-G-Gah|If you inflicted it on her, shouldn't you be filling the hole?
 Empathy, Finn. |Aah!
 I... should really get back to my sand.|Nah. You should come with us.
 Eeh!| Um, Door Man?
  I'm Guard Man.|Well, I am Boy Man.
 Sure. |" ""Jer Man"" was really funny."

 Finn!|I'm okay. These guys mean business, though. If you look them in the eyes, they get outraged.
 I'm okay. These guys mean business, though. If you look them in the eyes, they get outraged.|You got all that, Betty? Betty! Hup!
 Oh! There's more on this side.| Hyup!
 I found the next challenge! I think maybe if I solve this equation, we'll be able to pass through to the next chamber.|And if we mess up, that guy pecks our tummies open, right? 
  Look see? This quadrinomial has been improperly factored. He forgot to double cube root the bottom partial nominator.  There we go. I'll have us out of here in no time.|Well, just let me know if you need any help - with anything besides these maths problems.
  X plus square, hypotenuse cubed plus Y minus three... |
 |Hey! He's jukin' the stats!
 What?|He's changing the dang numbers around!
 He's changing. Oh no.| Come on, Jermaine!
 |Hey!
 Hey!| If anyone else feels like solving any of these puzzles, just jump right in, you know?
 Uh-doy!|You looks so happy. And sane.
 Good point, Future Betty! Maybe it is too late to save you, but with your power and my joie de vivre-ay, maybe the two of us could save Simon together! Think about it.|Oh, come on, Betty! Get it together! Even if you are a lost cause, she-
 -Or whatever she represents-|-is not.
  And don't forget to water my plants. Okay, got to go! My flight leaves in an hour!|Good job, Betty.
 Oh really?|Anyway, where's the space thingy?  Space thingy! Space thingy!
 Hey everybody.|Hey, long time no see, brudda! 
  Hey, what's with the hair, brudda?|Man, you're lucky you missed it. I had lice crazy-bad! I think I got them from Marceline, who got them from Ice King.
  Nice.|Anyway, how'd you even get here?
 Congratulations, everybody. Now, who's ready for a nice boiled egg?|Me!
 Finn, you donked up my recon!|I've got some important stuff to say.  I don't think going to war with your uncle is a good idea.
 I don't have any choice. By building an army, he's forcing my hand.|It seems to me that all these rhubarbs down through history don't do nobody no good.
 It's gonna happen, son. Best thing to do is sharpen your sword and stock up on flower wreaths. |You're dark, Colonel Candy Corn.
 How'd it go?|No good. PB is on the road to war.
 No good. PB is on the road to war.|Jake, it's up to us to fix things with Uncle Gumbald.
  Uh, take this, you banana face.|Does everyone have to get caught up in this mentality? I'm going to march right over to Gumbaldia on a last-ditch diplomatic mission. Want to come?
  Do I?  This is cute, right?|You bet! And that's the number one priority for kick-butt diplomacy - the cuteness offensive!
 You bet! And that's the number one priority for kick-butt diplomacy - the cuteness offensive!|Hey, this is kinda backwards, right?
 How so?|I used to be all about violence. Now it's, like, I'm different.
 Halt!|Gumbald?
 None shall pass.| Fern.
  Cuteness offensive. | Okay.  I don't wanna fight! I'm just here to see your boss.
  Okay.  I don't wanna fight! I'm just here to see your boss.|Fern, I know we have beef, but let's just talk. I didn't even know you were alive.
 Cool sword.|Fern, stop!
  Yes, Aunt Lolly.|"""Aunt Lolly"" - she sounds kind of like mom, yeah?"
 Hey! She was my mom too!|I know, man. We're like family. So why are we fighting?
  Sorry about him. Now what's a sweet boy like you doing here?|I'm trying to stop this ridiculous war. I mean, this whole thing is crazy, right?
 Gumbald is becoming so paranoid and erratic. All he talks about is baking that wretched, wretched cake. Maybe you can talk some sense into him.|Did you say he's baking a cake?
 So, it begins. |Wait! I'm a diplomacy boy today!
 I think we can trust him.| Stop.
  I'll hear your case boy, but I've got a busy day. We'll have to walk and talk.|Look, PB doesn't want to attack you. You're gum from the same sidewalk. Like, just look at this bomb secret laboratory over here. This is exactly the kind of thing PB would have.
  Then why is she building up her arms?  You see this? This is her forcing my hand. |But that's exactly what she's saying. You're both so unreasonable.
 This magnificent dessert shall make the whole war relatively swift and painless.|So there's truly nothing I can say to change your mind?
 Princess Bubblegum has made her bed, and now she must lie in it. But not get back up because she'll be dead. |I was wrong about you. You're nothing like Bonnie.
 No! No, no, no, no, no! Aah!|Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. The pain is astonishing.
 You could have let me die and saved your princess a lot of trouble. Maybe there is a way to co-exist after all.| Hey-o. That's what I like to hear. Sorry. I'm worried if I turn my neck my head might snap off.
  Hey-o. That's what I like to hear. Sorry. I'm worried if I turn my neck my head might snap off.|So Jake is literally inside me, controlling my body and I'm standing in front of my girlfriend's entire family.
  No!|This is my first ever girlfriend. I really want her to like me.
 You're as funny as me - the funny one!|Thanks, Chicle. But, if I could get serious for a second -
 No need, Finn. Your example has said more than words ever could. Chicle, fetch the celebration bucket. I declare all hostilities between Gumbaldia and the Candy Kingdom ended. |Yeah!
 Be sure to give Bonnie a big hug from me when you tell her.|You guys are goofballs.
 I don't believe it. A signed peace treaty? Finn, you're amazing. I could hug you right no- ...Did you stop at a craft store on the way here?|Oh, the glitter juice. It's part of a weird Gumbaldia treaty-signing ritual. Once I got to know him, your uncle was actually pretty cool. As I get older, I see the most important thing is to empathize with my friends and enemies. Like, co-exist instead of cutting off people's heads and stuff.
  You've been doused with Gumbald's dumdum solution!  Gumbald!|Where are you going!?
 Hoopty hoo, hoopty hey! Let's cut 'em up, folks. |I donked up.
 Well, get ready to have your hair blown back!|Hey, there it is again! It's close.
 Let me see!| It looks like Normal Man, Betty, and...  Maja?
  Come on!|Hey, just-
 Let me-  Maja's got smoke coming off her.|You think they're with the Gumbaldians?
 I don't know, but they're flippin' freakin' me out.  Guess we better tell PB, huh?| Yeah, I guess.
 Well I do, so we're doing this my way. Now-|Um, PB?
 Finn, you're back. How goes the scouting?|Um-
 Hmm, very peculiar.|Hey, maybe this is, like, a bad omen. Like, to see the King of Mars, um, up among the stars? It's like a bad omen, and you should call off the battle. I think I heard that somewhere...
  What if PB's right about this? Maybe she'll just go whup Gumbald's rear, and then things'll go back to normal.|Nah, man, she's wrong. This is all wrong. Even if she wins now, this is never gonna end; I can feel it. It's like the whole world's going crazy, man, like we're living in, one, big... 
 Finn?|... one big nightmare.
 Yes?  I'm doing it! I'm soundin' the war horn! |Wait!
 What!?  Dang it, Finn!|PB! He sees that you're serious! Maybe he'll back down now. Please listen to me! We've been friends for a long time. 
 What?  Come on.|Here they come!
 Hurry this up. I want a war.|Hey, Fern.
 What is this place? Finn?|Last resort! Sorry, PB, but you were acting like total nuts out there. Now you guys have to hash this out in the unconscious world.
 Psst! Not if I destroy you first!|No! We need love, not war!
 No!|Thank goodness for a singing pot beast to de-escalate the situation.
 He's rooting into the ground. Ready, aim...|No!  You're supposed to be having some kind of epiphany!
  Here's my epiphany|Fern!  Come on! Snap out of it, man!  Aah!
 I don't need your help. |Jake? Help me!
  Waiter! Oh, waiter!|Dude...
 I'm going to fly around, and wreck things, until I feel better! Or until I tire myself out.|Peaceful thoughts...  Fern!
 So be it.|If you could just calm down and be cool, it would be a great thing that there's two of us.
 Why don't you just fight me like a real butterfly!?|We're two sides of the same coin!
 You'll never understand what it's like to be me. I'm TORMENTED!|I'm ALSO that sometimes!
 Hmm?  Finn, we'll be right back.|Okay- ah! 
 Proof! |See? this is our shared torment!
 Dude, I blocked this stuff out for a reason!| Well, now you know how I feel about knowing how you feel about!
  Okay, okay! Just make it stop!|We gotta confront them head on!
 We gotta confront them head on!|Fern. This is why I brought us here. We can defeat him together.
 No fear.|So you're the nasty grass wad that's been holding my Finn boy hostage.
 Without me, he's got no body. So back off. |You sicken me.
  They're dead! They're actually dead!  Never mind! They're okay!|Fern! You really are disintegrating!
 We donked up for real. |Jake... what am I lookin' at?
 Yes!|FYI, Princess, I'm not going anywhere!
  Cake, pick me up!  My friends! It is time to set aside past differences! We must join the fight!  Hmm! Forwards! |Normal Man! Come on, wake up!
  Is that Ice King?|How do we stop these guys?  Come on, Jake.
  Ho-ho-ho.|How do I stop this!  What?
 Don't worry, guys! |Jake!
 You're welcome.|Betty! You have to stop this!
 Don't panic, but I think Golb is digesting us.  Breaking us apart, layer by layer,   ...down to our essential forms.|I'll get us outta here. 
 It's good to be seen. |Hey, Ice Simon! Use the crown before we're totally crushed!
 I don't know if we can kill Golb with music, PB!| I always figured I'd go out saving somebody.
 Hey, no one gets to choose how it happens. The most important thing is that we're here together.| Shh, shh! Do you hear that? It sounds like Jake.  Oh-ho, it is Jake! Look, we can leave this way!
 This world will end unless GOLB is banished. So I'm gonna make... the wish.|Guys, it's clenching!
 We heard there was a war- |She did it! Yeah, Betty! Whoo!
 And for some drums, I guess? Yeah, this is fine.|Whew.
  Hey, Finn... I'm not doing so good.|Oh, no.
 Yeah...  I just wish I could see the treehouse one more time.|Yeah dude, of course! Let's go there right now.
 Hey, Finn.| Excuse me. Hi, PB.
 I just wanted to come say... thank you for disobeying my orders this morning. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? |See you tomorrow.
 Oh, a big tree... Hey! I know where that tree is! C'mon, Beth!|I came pretty close to biting it back there. I never would have gotten out of there without your singing. It's amazing how strong that song was.
 Music is powerful, man. It speaks to a primal pit in our brains. It makes anyone wanna get up and get their knees goin', gotta get 'em pumpin' pumpin' pumpin'. Boompa-boompa-boom.| What do you think, Music Hole?
 Sure!|Yeah!
 Aha! | Head's up! Oof.
 Oof.|I got that bucket of pure river water you asked for. 
 Thanks, dude.|Whatcha doing down here anyways?
 Digging up diamonds for a little project.|I'll help, buddy.
 Hehe.  Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods!|What the heck man?!  It's such a senseless waste.
 Au contraire, mon friend. I'm extremely senseful. You see this bucket of water? It's in case I fall in the lava and catch fire.|You could make something really good with these. Like a better sword for your best bro.
 Or .| I'm gonna take this shiny boy, and show you the way.
 You do you, buddy.|I'm sure you'd get it if you just took a moment to think about it. 
 Who here loves windmills?  Haha, alright. Now get to work.|Yo, Marcy. That's a real nice windmill.
 Keep working, buddy. So, whatcha got there?|A little lump destined for something big.
 Just like your butt. Hah!|Good one. But no. I want to turn this diamond into something complex and awesome to really wow Jake.
 Well I recommend building a windmill.|A diamond windmill.
 No, that's silly. You need something more sciencey.  Diamond, lapis, some gunpowder, juicy nugget, add the star to more gunpowder and paper - There!  I'm positive Jake will appreciate it for both its fleeting sensation of beauty, and its false sense of purpose.| Up top.
 What? Aw blocks.|He's been at it all day.
 I should help him. See you later Finn.|Alright. M'ladies.  M'lemon. 
 Oh shoot, I only got two.|Hey y'all. 
 Finn!|I was just passing through, but I could sure go for one of your famous apple pies.
 Say no more. |I'm no expert, but that kinda looks like a pumpkin.
  Sorry about that. I'm just plum out of apples but I got lots of pumpkins. Too many pumpkins.  Hot pie.| Uh, this might sound a bit weird but I'm kinda tired and it's a long way home...
 Bye bye boys.|Whoa!
  You know you could just tell me where to go.| Dude, stop. Enderman. Don't look at it. It will-
 What the heck is that?!|Oh Glob.
 Oh Glob.|Hey!
 Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee!|Enderman! Fight me!  Oh no.
 Enderman! Fight me!  Oh no.|So, uh... Do you have, like, another job, or is this what you do full time? I saw you carrying that block back there. You into building stuff?
 So, uh... Do you have, like, another job, or is this what you do full time? I saw you carrying that block back there. You into building stuff?|I bet endermen have hobbies just like everyone else.
  Meh. Beh. Beans? Beans.  That noise.  Finn, I'm trying to sleep!| Hey LSP. Don't be scared.
  What are you even doing, just looking at this guy's toes?|Yeah, I have to.
 Oh. I don't get it. Does this guy even have toes? Are those his toes? I don't think I've ever even seen a toe, come to think of it. What am I even talking about?| Thank you I've been stuck here so long!
  Haha. Sure... Ew! You're all smelly and wet. Get out of here!|Fair enough. 
 Other|Thief!
 Pie.|You won't believe what I went though to get this.
 Oh yeah, you were gonna make something right? | Whoa! You did it! You took the fruits of our labor and transformed them into something beautiful and unexpected.
  Whoa! You did it! You took the fruits of our labor and transformed them into something beautiful and unexpected.|D'aw come on! Diamonds are so hard to get!  Oh, duh. Beauty is in the hard work itself and the oftentimes false sense of purpose we feel when doing it. It's a fleeting sensation that drives us to repeat our actions in order to capture it again.  That was supposed to be fireworks.
